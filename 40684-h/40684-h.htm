<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In presenting this volume to the women of
America, the author would remark that, at least
as far as she is aware, it is the first one, exclusively
devoted to the instruction of lady riders,
that has ever been written by one of their own
countrywomen. In its preparation, no pretension
is made to the style of a practiced author,
the writer freely acknowledging it to be her
first venture in the (to her) hitherto unexplored
regions of authorship; she has simply
undertaken,&mdash;being guided and aided by her
own experience in horseback riding,&mdash;to write,
in plain and comprehensive language, and in
as concise a manner as is compatible with a
clear understanding of her subject, all that she
deems it essential for a horsewoman to know.
This she has endeavored to do without any affectation
or effort to acquire reputation as an
author, and wholly for the purpose of benefiting
those of her own sex who wish to learn not
only to ride, but to ride well. She has also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
been induced to prepare the work by the urgent
solicitations of many lady friends, who,
desirous of having thorough information on
horseback riding, were unable to find in any single
work those instructions which they needed.</p>

<p>Many valuable works relating to the subject
could be had, but none especially for ladies.
True, in many of these works prepared for
equestrians a few pages of remarks or advice
to horsewomen could be found, but so scant
and limited were they that but little useful
and practical information could be gleaned
from them. The writers of these works never
even dreamed of treating many very important
points highly essential to the horsewoman;
and, indeed, it could hardly be expected that
they would, as it is almost impossible for any
horseman to know, much less to comprehend,
these points. The position of a man in the saddle
is natural and easy, while that of a woman
is artificial, one-sided, and less readily acquired;
that which he can accomplish with facility is
for her impossible or extremely difficult, as her
position lessens her command over the horse,
and obliges her to depend almost entirely upon
her skill and address for the means of controlling
him.</p>

<p>If a gentleman will place himself upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
side-saddle and for a short time ride the several
gaits of his horse, he will have many points
presented which he had not anticipated, and
which may puzzle him; that which appeared
simple and easy when in his natural position
will become difficult of performance when he
assumes the rôle of a horsewoman. A trial of
this kind will demonstrate to him that the rules
applicable to the one will not invariably be
adapted to the other. The reader need not be
surprised, therefore, if in the perusal of this
volume she discovers in certain instances instructions
laid down which differ from those
met with in the popular works upon this subject
by male authors.</p>

<p>Another inducement to prepare this volume
existed in the fact that the ladies throughout
the country, and especially in our large cities
and towns, are apparently awakening to an
appreciation of the importance of out-door
amusement and exercise in securing and prolonging
health, strength, beauty, and symmetry
of form, and that horseback riding is rapidly becoming
the favorite form of such exercise. Instructions
relating to riding have become, therefore,
imperative, in order to supply a need long
felt by those horsewomen who, when in the
saddle, are desirous of acquitting themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
with credit, but who have heretofore been unable
to gain that information which would enable
them to ride with ease and grace, and to
manage their steeds with dexterity and confidence.
The author&mdash;who has had several
years' experience in horseback riding with the
old-fashioned, two-pommeled saddle, and, in
later years, with the English saddle, besides
having had the benefit of the best continental
teaching&mdash;believes she will be accused of
neither vanity nor egotism when she states that
within the pages of this work instructions will
be found amply sufficient to enable any lady
who attends to them to ride with artistic correctness.</p>

<p>Great care has been taken to enter upon and
elucidate all those minute but important details
which are so essential, but which, because they
are so simple, are usually passed over without
notice or explanation. Especial attention has
also been given to the errors of inexperienced
and uneducated riders, as well as to the mistakes
into which beginners are apt to fall from
incorrect modes of teaching, or from no instruction
at all; these errors have been carefully
pointed out, and the methods for correcting
them explained. A constant effort has been
made to have these practical hints and valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
explanations as lucid as possible, that they may
readily be comprehended and put into practical
use by the reader.</p>

<p>From the fact that considerable gossip, including
some truth, as to illiteracy, rudeness,
offensive familiarity, and scandal of various
kinds has in past years been associated with
some of the riding-schools established in our
cities, many ladies entertain a decided antipathy
to all riding-schools; to these ladies, as well as
to those who are living in places where no riding-schools
exist, the author feels confident that
this work will prove of great practical utility.
Yet she must remark that, in her opinion, it is
neither just nor right to ostracize indiscriminately
all such schools, simply because some of
them have proven blameworthy; whenever a
riding-school of good standing is established and
is conducted by a well-known, competent, and
gentlemanly teacher, with one or more skilled
lady assistants, she would advise the ladies of
the neighborhood to avail themselves of such
opportunity to become sooner thorough and
efficient horsewomen by pursuing the instructions
given in this work under such qualified
teachers.</p>

<span class="i0">"How melts my beating heart as I behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each lovely nymph, our island's boast and pride,<br /></span>

<p class="citation"><i>The Chase.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among ladies of wealth and culture in England,
the equestrienne art forms a portion of
their education as much as the knowledge of
their own language, of French, or of music, and
great care is taken that their acquirements in
this art shall be as thorough as those in any
other branch of their tuition. The mother bestows
much of her own personal supervision
on her daughter's instruction, closely watching
for every little fault, and promptly correcting
it when any becomes manifest. As a result
universally acknowledged, a young English
lady, when riding a well-trained and spirited
horse, is a sight at once elegant and attractive.
She exhibits a degree of confidence, a firmness
of seat, and an ease and grace that can be
acquired only by the most careful and correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
instruction. The fair rider guides her steed,
without abruptness, from walk to canter, from
canter to trot, every movement in perfect harmony;
horse and rider being, as it were, of one
thought.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Each look, each motion, awakes a new-born grace."</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, at the present day, from want
of careful study of the subject, the majority of
American lady riders, notwithstanding the elegance
of their forms and their natural grace,
by no means equal their English sisters in the
art of riding. In most instances, a faulty position
in the saddle, an unsteadiness of seat, and
a lack of sympathy between horse and rider,
occasion in the mind of the spectator a sense
of uneasiness lest the horse, in making playful
movements, or, perhaps, becoming slightly
fractious, may unseat his rider,&mdash;a feeling
which quite destroys the charm and fascination
she might otherwise exercise. If my countrywomen
would but make a master stroke, and
add correct horseback riding to the long list
of accomplishments which they now possess,
they would become irresistible, and while delighting
others, would likewise promote their
own physical well-being. There is no cosmetic
nor physician's skill which can preserve the
bloom and freshness of youth as riding can,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and my fair readers, if they wish to prolong
those charms for which they are world renowned,
charms whose only fault is their too
fleeting existence, must take exercise, and be
more in the fresh air and sunshine.</p>

<p>How much better to keep old age at bay by
these innocent means, than to resort to measures
which give to the eye of the world a counterfeit
youth that will not deceive for a moment.
Even an elderly lady may without offense or
harsh criticism recall some of the past joys of
younger years by an occasional ride for health
or recreation, and, while gracefully accepting
her half century, or more, of life, she can still
retain some of the freshness and spirit of bygone
years.</p>

<p>Not only is health preserved and life prolonged
by exercise on horseback, but, in addition,
sickness is banished, or meliorated, and
melancholy, that dark demon which occasionally
haunts even the most joyous life, is overcome
and driven back to the dark shades from
whence it came. Should the reader have the
good fortune to possess an intelligent horse, she
can, when assailed by sorrows real or fancied,
turn to this true, willing friend, whose affectionate
neigh of greeting as she approaches,
and whose pretty little graceful arts, will tend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to dispel her gloom, and, once in the saddle,
speeding along through the freshening air, fancied
griefs are soon forgotten, while strength
and nerve are gained to face those troubles
of a more serious nature, whose existence cannot
be ignored.</p>

<p>To the mistress who thoroughly understands
the art of managing him, the horse gives his
entire affection and obedience, becomes her
most willing slave, submits to all her whims,
and is proud and happy under her rule.</p>

<p>In disposition the horse is much like a child.
Both are governed by kindness combined with
firmness; both meet indifference with indifference,
but return tenfold in love and obedience
any care or affection that is bestowed upon
them. The horse also resembles the child in
the keenness with which he detects hypocrisy;
no pretense of love or interest will impose on
either.</p>

<p>To the lady rider who has neither real fondness
for her horse nor knowledge of governing
him, there is left but one resource by means of
which the animal can be controlled, and this is
the passion of fear. With a determined will,
she may, by whipping, force him to obey, but
this means is not always reliable, especially
with a high-spirited animal, nor is it a method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which any true woman would care to employ.
If, in addition to indifference to the horse, there
be added nervousness and timidity, which she
finds herself unable to overcome by practice
and association, the lady might as well relinquish
all attempt to become a rider.</p>

<p>Should any of my readers think that these
views of the relations between horse and rider
are too sentimental, that all which is needed in
a horse is easy movement, obedience to the
reins, and readiness to go forward when urged,
and that love and respect are quite unnecessary,
she will find, should she ever meet with any
really alarming object on the road, that a little
of this despised affection and confidence is very
desirable, for, in the moment of danger, the
voice which has never spoken in caressing accents,
nor sought to win confidence will be unheeded;
fear will prevail over careful training,
and the rider will be very fortunate if she escapes
without an accident. The writer is sustained
in the idea that the affection of the
horse is essential to the safety of the rider, not
only by her own experience, but also by that
of some of the most eminent teachers of riding,
and trainers of horses.</p>

<p>Maud S. is an example of what a firm
yet kind rule will effect in bringing forth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
capabilities of a horse. She has never had a
harsh word spoken to her, and has never been
punished with the whip, but has, on the contrary,
been trained with the most patient and
loving care; and the result has been a speed
so marvelous as to have positively astonished
the world, for although naturally high tempered,
she will strain every nerve to please her
kind, loving master, when urged forward by his
voice alone.</p>

<p>Some ladies acquire a dislike for horseback
riding, either because they experience discomfort
or uneasiness when in the saddle, or because
the movements of their horses cause them
considerable fatigue. There may be various
reasons for this: the saddle may be too large,
or too small, or improperly made; or the rider's
position in the saddle may be incorrect, and as
a consequence, the animal cannot be brought
to his best paces. Discomfort may occasionally
be caused by an improperly made riding-habit.
The rider whose waist is confined by tight
lacing cannot adapt herself to the motions of
her horse, and the graceful pliancy so essential
to good riding will, therefore, be lost. The
lady who wears tight corsets can never become
a thorough rider, nor will the exercise of riding
give her either pleasure or health. She may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
manage to look well when riding at a gait no
faster than a walk, but, beyond this, her motions
will appear rigid and uncomfortable. A
quick pace will induce rapid circulation, and
the blood, checked at the waist, will, like a
stream which has met with an obstacle in its
course, turn into other channels, rushing either
to the heart, causing faintness, or to the head,
producing headache and vertigo. There have
even been instances of a serious nature, where
expectoration of blood has been occasioned by
horseback riding, when the rider was tightly
laced.</p>

<p>The naturally slender, symmetrical figure,
when in the saddle, is the perfection of beauty,
but she whom nature has endowed with more
ample proportions will never attain this perfection
by pinching her waist in. Let the full figure
be left to nature, its owner sitting well in
the saddle, on a horse adapted to her style, and
she will make a very imposing appearance, and
prove a formidable rival to her more slender
companion.</p>

<p>There is a mistaken idea prevalent among
certain persons, that horseback riding induces
obesity. It is true that, to a certain extent,
riding favors healthy muscular development,
but the same may be said of all kinds of exercise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and this effect, far from being objectionable,
is highly desirable, as it contributes to symmetry
of form, as well as to health and strength,
conditions that in a large proportion of our
American women are unfortunately lacking.
Those who ride on horseback will find that
while gaining in strength and proper physical
tissue, they will, at the same time, as a rule, be
gradually losing all excess of flesh; it is impossible
for an active rider to become fat or flabby;
but the indolent woman who is prejudiced
against exercise of any kind will soon find the
much dreaded calamity, corpulency, overtaking
her, and beauty of form more or less rapidly
disappearing beneath a mountain of flesh.</p>

<p>There are many persons who entertain the
mistaken idea that instinct is a sufficient guide
in learning to ride; that it is quite unnecessary
to take any lessons or to make a study of the
art of correct riding; and that youth, a good
figure, and practice are all that is required to
make a finished rider. This is a most erroneous
opinion, which has been productive of
much harm to lady riders. The above qualifications
are undoubtedly great assistants, but
without correct instruction they will never
produce an accomplished and graceful rider.</p>

<p>The instinctive horsewoman usually rides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
boldly and with perfect satisfaction to herself,
but to the eye of the connoisseur she presents
many glaring defects. Very bold, but, at the
same time, very bad riding is often seen among
those who consider themselves very fine horsewomen.
In order to gain the reputation of a
finished rider, it is not essential that one should
perform all the antics of a circus rider, nor that
she should ride a Mazeppian horse. The finished
rider may be known by the correctness of
her attitude in the saddle, by her complete control
of her horse, and by the tranquillity of her
motions when in city or park; in such places
she makes no attempt to ride at a very rapid
trot, or flying gallop-gaits which should be reserved
for country roads, where more speed is
allowable.</p>

<p>There is still another false idea prevalent
among a certain class of people, which is that
a love for horses, and for horseback riding necessarily
makes one coarse, and detracts from
the refinement of a woman's nature. It must
be acknowledged that the coarseness of a vulgar
spirit can be nowhere more conspicuously
displayed than in the saddle, and yet in no
place is the delicacy and decorum of woman
more observable. A person on horseback is
placed in a position where every motion is subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to critical observation and comment. The
quiet, simple costume, the easy movements, the
absence of ostentatious display, will always proclaim
the refined, well-bred rider. Rudeness in
the saddle is as much out of place as in the
parlor or salon, and greatly more annoying to
spectators, besides being disrespectful and dangerous
to other riders. Abrupt movements,
awkward and rapid paces, frequently cause
neighboring horses to become restless, and even
to run away. Because a lady loves her horse,
and enjoys riding him, it is by no means necessary
that she should become a Lady Gay Spanker,
indulge in stable talk, make familiars of
grooms and stable boys, or follow the hounds in
the hunting field.</p>

<p>There are in this work no especial instructions
given for the hunting field, as the author
does not consider it a suitable place for a lady
rider. She believes that no lady should risk
life and limb in leaping high and dangerous
obstacles, but that all such daring feats should
be left to the other sex or to circus actresses.
Nor would any woman who really cared for her
horse wish to run the risk of reducing him to
the deplorable condition of many horses that
follow the hounds. In England, where hunting
is the favorite pastime among gentlemen, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
number of maimed and crippled horses that one
meets is disheartening. Every lady, however,
who desires to become a finished rider, should
learn to leap, as this will not only aid her in securing
a good seat in the saddle, but may also
prove of value in times of danger.</p>

<p>Before concluding I would again urge upon
my readers the importance of out-of-door exercise,
which can hardly be taken in a more agreeable
form than that of horseback riding,&mdash;a
great panacea, giving rest and refreshment to
the overworked brain of the student, counteracting
many of the pernicious effects of the luxurious
lives of the wealthy, and acting upon the
workers of the world as a tonic, and as a stimulus
to greater exertion.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the original home of the
horse was central Asia, and that all the wild
horses that range over the steppes of Tartary,
the pampas of South America, and the prairies
of North America, are descendants of this Asiatic
stock.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> There is, in the history of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
world, no accurate statement of the time when
the horse was first subjugated by man, but so
far back as his career can be traced in the dim
and shadowy past, he seems to have been man's
servant and companion. We find him, on the
mysterious ruins of ancient Egypt, represented
with his badge of servitude, the bridle; he figures
in myth and fable as the companion of
man and gods; he is a prominent figure in the
pictured battle scenes of the ancient world; and
has always been a favorite theme with poet, historian,
and philosopher in all ages.</p>

<p>The first written record, known to us, of the
subjection of the horse to man is found in the
Bible, where in Genesis (xlvii. 17) it is stated
that Joseph gave the Egyptians bread in exchange
for their horses, and in 1. 9, we read
that when Joseph went to bury his father Jacob,
there went with him the servants of the
house of Pharaoh, the elders of the land of
Egypt, together with "chariots and horsemen"
in numbers. Jeremiah compares the speed of
the horse with the swiftness of the eagle; and
Job's description of the war charger has never
been surpassed.</p>

<p>Ancient Rome paid homage to the horse by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
yearly festival, when every one abstained from
labor, and the day was made one of feasting and
frolic. The horse, decked with garlands, and
with gay and costly trappings, was led in triumph
through the streets, followed by a multitude
who loudly proclaimed in verse and song
his many good services to man.</p>

<p>This adulation of the horse sometimes went
beyond the bounds of reason, as in the case of
Caligula, who carried his love for his horse, Incitatus,
to an insane degree. He had a marble
palace erected for a stable, furnished it with
mangers of ivory and gold, and had sentinels
guard it at night that the repose of his favorite
might not be disturbed. Another elegant palace
was fitted up in the most splendid and costly
style, and here the animal's visitors were entertained.
Caligula required all who called upon
himself to visit Incitatus also, and to treat the
animal with the same respect and reverence as
that observed towards a royal host. This horse
was frequently introduced at Caligula's banquets,
where he was presented with gilded oats, and
with wine from a golden cup. Historians state
that Caligula would even have made his steed
consul of Rome, had not the tyrant been opportunely
assassinated, and the world freed from
an insane fiend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>In the legends of the Middle Ages the knight-errant
and his gallant steed were inseparable,
and together performed doughty deeds of valor
and chivalry. In our present more prosaic age,
the horse has been trained to such a degree of
perfection in speed and motion as was never
dreamed of by the ancients or by the knights of
the crusades; and there has been given to the
world an animal that is a marvel of courage,
swiftness, and endurance, while, at the same
time, so docile, that the delicate hand of woman
can completely control him.</p>

<p>The Arabian is the patrician among horses;
he is the most intelligent, the most beautifully
formed, and, when kindly treated, the gentlest
of his race. He is especially noted for his keenness
of perception, his retentive memory, his
powers of endurance, and, when harshly or cruelly
treated, for his fierce resentment and ferociousness,
which nothing but death can conquer.
In his Arabian home he is guarded as a treasure,
is made one of the family and treated with
the most loving care. This close companionship
creates an affection and confidence between
the horse and his master which is almost unbounded;
while the kindness with which the
animal is treated seems to brighten his intelligence
as well as to render him gentle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>When these horses were first introduced into
Europe they seemed, after a short stay in civilization,
to have completely changed their nature,
and, instead of gentleness and docility,
exhibited an almost tiger-like ferocity. This
change was at first attributed to difference of
climate and high feeding, but, after several
grooms had been injured or killed by their
charges, it began to be suspected that there
was something wrong in the treatment. The
experiment of introducing native grooms was
therefore tried, and the results proved most satisfactory,
the animals once more becoming gentle
and docile.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Since then the nature of the
Arabian has become better understood, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
both in this country and in Europe, he shows,
at the present day, a decided improvement upon
the original native of the desert. He is larger
and swifter, yet still retains all the spirit as
well as docility of his ancestors. In America
his descendants are called "thorough-breds,"
and Americans may well be proud of this race
of horses, which is rapidly becoming world renowned.</p>

<p>Before purchasing a saddle-horse, several
points should be considered. First, <b>the style
of the rider's figure</b>; for a horse which would
be suitable for a large, stout person would not
be at all desirable for one having a small, slender
figure. A large, majestic looking woman
would present a very absurd spectacle when
mounted upon a slightly built, slender horse;
his narrow back in contrast with that of his
rider would cause hers to appear even larger
and wider than usual, and thus give her a heavy
and ridiculous appearance, while the little horse
would look overburdened and miserable, and
his step, being too short for his rider, would
cause her to experience an unpleasant sensation
of embarrassment and restraint. On the other
hand, a short, light, slender rider, seated upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
tall broad-backed animal, would appear equally
out of place; the step of the horse being, in her
case, too long, would make her seat unsteady
and insecure, so that instead of a sense of enjoyment,
exhilaration, and benefit from the ride,
she would experience only fatigue and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>If the rider be tall and rather plump, the
horse should be fifteen hands and three inches
in height, and have a somewhat broad back.
A lady below the medium height, and of slender
proportions, will look equally well when
riding a pony fourteen hands high, or a horse
fifteen hands. An animal fifteen hands, or fifteen
hands and two inches in height, will generally
be found suitable for all ladies who are
not excessively large and tall, or very short
and slender. In all cases, however, the back
of the horse should be long enough to appear
well under the side-saddle, for a horse with a
short back never presents a fine aspect when
carrying a woman. In such cases, the side-saddle
extends from his withers nearly, if not quite,
to his hips, and as the riding skirt covers his
left side, little is seen of the horse except his
head and tail. Horses with very short backs
are usually good weight-carriers, but their gaits
are apt to be rough and uneasy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Another point to be considered in the selection
of a horse is, what gait or gaits are best
suited to the rider, and here again the lady
should take her figure into consideration. The
walk, trot, canter, and gallop are the only gaits
recognized by English horsewomen, but in
America the walk, rack, pace, and canter are
the favorite gaits. If the lady's figure be slender
and elegant, any of the above named gaits
will suit her, but should she be large or stout,
a brisk walk or easy canter should be selected.
The rapid gallop and all fast gaits should be
left to light and active riders.</p>

<p>The fast or running walk is a very desirable
gait for any one, but is especially so for middle-aged
or stout people, who cannot endure much
jolting; it is also excellent for delicate women,
for poor riders, or for those who have long journeys
to make which they wish to accomplish
speedily and without undue fatigue to themselves
or their horses. A good sound horse
who has been trained to this walk can readily
travel thirty or forty miles a day, or even more.
This gait is adapted equally well to the street,
the park, and the country road; but it must be
acknowledged that horses possessing it rarely
have any other that is desirable, and, indeed,
any other would be apt to impair the ease and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
harmony of the animal's movements in this
walk.</p>

<p>The French or cavalry trot (see <a href="#Page_203" class="inref">page 203</a>)
should never be ridden on the road by a woman,
as the movements of the horse in this gait
are so very rough that the most accomplished
rider cannot keep a firm, steady seat. The
body is jolted in a peculiar and very unpleasant
manner, occasioning a sense of fatigue that is
readily appreciated, though difficult to describe.</p>

<p>The country jog-trot is another very fatiguing
gait, although farmers, who ride it a good
deal, state that "after one gets used to it, it is
not at all tiresome." But a lady's seat in the
saddle is so different from that of a gentleman's
that she can never ride this gait without excessive
fatigue.</p>

<p>A rough racker or pacer will prove almost
as wearisome as the jog-trotter. Indeed, if she
wishes to gain any pleasure or benefit from
riding, a lady should never mount a horse that
is at all stiff or uneven in his movements, no
matter what may be his gait.</p>

<p>The easiest of all gaits to ride, although the
most difficult to learn, is the English trot. This
is especially adapted to short persons, who can
ride it to perfection. A tall woman will be apt
to lean too far forward when rising in it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
her specialties, therefore, should be the canter
and the gallop, in which she can appear to the
greatest advantage. The rack, and the pace of
a horse that has easy movements are not at all
difficult to learn to ride, and are, consequently,
the favorite gaits of poor riders.</p>

<p>In selecting a horse his <b>temperament</b> must
also be considered. A high-spirited, nervous
animal, full of vitality, highly satisfactory as he
might prove to some, would be only a source
of misery to others of less courageous dispositions.
First lessons in riding should be taken
upon a horse of cold temperament and kindly
disposition who will resent neither mistakes nor
awkwardness. Having learned to ride and to
manage a horse properly, no steed can then be
too mettlesome for the healthy and active lady
pupil, provided he has no vices and possesses
the good manners that should always belong
to every lady's horse.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to believe, as many do,
that a weak, slightly built horse is yet capable
of carrying a woman. On the contrary, a lady's
horse should be the soundest and best that can
be procured, and should be able to carry with
perfect ease a weight much greater than hers.
A slight, weak animal, if ridden much by a
woman, will be certain to "get out of condition,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
will become unsound in the limbs of one
side, usually the left, and will soon wear out.</p>

<p>Before buying a horse, the lady who is to ride
him should be weighed, and should then have
some one who is considerably heavier than herself
ride the animal, that she may be sure that
her own weight will not be too great for him.
If he carries the heavier weight with ease, he
can, of course, carry her.</p>

<p>In selecting a horse great care should be
taken to ascertain whether there is the least
trace of <b>unsoundness in his feet and legs</b>, and
especially that variety of unsoundness which occasions
stumbling. The best of horses, when
going over rough places or when very tired
may stumble, and so will indolent horses that
are too lazy when traveling to lift their feet
up fully; but when this fault is due to disease,
or becomes a habit with a lazy animal, he
should never be used under the side-saddle.</p>

<p>If the reader will glance at Figs. 1 and 2, she
will observe the difference between the head of
the low-bred horse and that of the best bred of
the race. <a href="#Fig_1" class="inref">Fig. 1</a> represents the head of an Arabian
horse; the brain is wide between the eyes,
the brow high and prominent, and the expression
of the face high-bred and intelligent. <a href="#Fig_2" class="inref">Fig.
2</a> shows the head of a low-bred horse, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stupid aspect and small brain are very manifest.
The one horse will be quick to comprehend
what is required of him, and will appreciate any
efforts made to brighten his intelligence, while
the other will be slow to understand, almost indifferent
to the kindness of his master, and apt,
when too much indulged, to return treachery
for good treatment. The whip, when applied to
the latter as a means of punishment, will probably
cow him, but, if used for the same purpose
on the former, will rouse in him all the hot
temper derived from his ancestors, and in the
contest which ensues between his master and
himself, he will conquer, or terminate the strife
his own death, or that of his master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Another noticeable feature in the Arab horse,
and one usually considered significant of an active
and wide-awake temperament, is the width
and expansiveness of the nostrils. These, upon
the least excitement, will quiver and expand,
and in a rapid gallop will stand out freely, giving
a singularly spirited look to the animal's
face.</p>

<p>The shape and size of the ears are also indications
of high or low birth. In the high-bred
horse they are generally small, thin, and delicate
on their outer margins, with the tips inclined
somewhat towards one another. By
means of these organs the animal expresses his
different emotions of anger, fear, dislike, or gayety.
They may be termed his language, and
their various movements can readily be understood
when one takes a little trouble to study
their indications. The ears of a low-bred horse
are large, thick, and covered with coarse hair;
they sometimes lop or droop horizontally, protruding
from the sides of the head and giving
a very sheepish look to the face; they rarely
move, and express very little emotion of any
kind.</p>

<p>The eye of the desert steed is very beautiful,
possessing all the brilliancy and gentleness so
much admired in that of the gazelle. Its expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in repose is one of mildness and amiability,
but, under the influence of excitement, it
dilates widely and sparkles. A horse which has
small eyes set close together, no matter what
excellences he may possess in other respects, is
sure to have some taint of inferior blood. Some
of the coarser breeds have the large eye of the
Arabian, but it will usually be found that they
have some thorough-bred among their ancestors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;Width of lower jaw in the thorough-bred.</p>
</div>

<p>Width between the sides or branches of the
lower jaw is another
distinctive feature
of the horse of
pure descent. (<a href="#Fig_3" class="inref">Fig.
3.</a>) A wide furrow
or channel between
the points mentioned is necessary for speed, in
order to allow room for free respiration when
the animal is in rapid motion. The coarser
breeds have very small, narrow channels (<a href="#Fig_4" class="inref">Fig.
4</a>), and very rapid motion soon distresses them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Width of lower jaw in the low-bred.</p>
</div>

<p>The mouth of the well-bred horse is large, allowing
ample room
for the bit, and giving
him a determined
and energetic,
but at the
same time pleasant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
amiable expression. The mouth of the low-bred
horse is small and covered with coarse
hair, and gives the animal a sulky, dejected appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_5"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;Oblique shoulder.<br />
The angle at the joint being about 45°.</p>
</div>

<p>The light, elegant head of the Arabian is well
set on his neck; a slight convexity at the upper
part of the throat gives freedom to the
functions of this organ, as well as elasticity to
the movements of the head and neck; and
the <i>encolure</i>, or crest of the neck, is arched with
a graceful curve. But it is especially in the
shape of the shoulders that this horse excels all
others, and this is the secret of those easy movements
which make him so desirable for the saddle.
These shoulders are deep, and placed obliquely
at an angle of about
45°; they act like the springs
of a well-made carriage, diminishing
the shock or jar of
his movements. They are always
accompanied by a deep
chest, high withers, and fore-legs
set well forward, qualities
which make the horse much
safer for riding. (<a href="#Fig_5" class="inref">Fig. 5.</a>)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/fig6.jpg" width="294" height="300" alt="Fig. 6.&mdash;Straight or upright
shoulder. The angle at the joint being more than 45°." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;Straight or upright shoulder.<br /> The angle at the
joint being more than 45°.</p>
</div>

<p>The animal with straight shoulders, no matter
how well shaped in other respects, can never
make a good saddle-horse, and should be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
once rejected. These shoulders are usually accompanied
by low withers, and fore-legs placed
too far under the body,
which arrangement causes
the rider an unpleasant jar
every time a fore-foot touches
the ground. Moreover, the
gait of the horse is constrained
and not always
safe, and if he be used much
under the saddle his fore-feet will soon become
unsound. This straight, upright shoulder is
characteristic of the coarser breeds of horses,
and is frequently associated with a short, thick
neck. Such horses are not only unfit for the
saddle, but, when any speed is desired, are unsuitable
even for a pleasure carriage. (<a href="#Fig_6" class="inref">Fig. 6.</a>)</p>

<p>The haunch of the low-bred horse is generally
large, but not so well formed as that of the
thorough-bred. This portion of the Arabian
courser is wide, indicating strength, and force
to propel himself forward, while his tail, standing
out gayly when he is in motion, projects in
a line with his back-bone. His forearm is large,
long, and muscular,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> his knees broad and firm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
his hocks of considerable size, while his cannon-bone,
situated between the knee and the fetlock,
is short, although presenting a broad appearance
when viewed laterally.</p>

<p>On each front leg, at the back of the knee,
there is a bony projection, giving attachments
to the flexor muscles, and affording protection
to certain tendons. The Orientals set a great
value upon the presence of this bone, believing
that it favors muscular action, and the larger
this prominence is the more highly do they
prize the animal that possesses it. The pasterns
of the high-bred horse are of medium length,
and very elastic, while the foot is circular and
of moderate size.</p>

<p>In the preceding description, the author has
endeavored to make plain to the reader the
most important points to be observed in both
the high-bred and the low-bred horse, and has
given the most pronounced characteristics of
each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Between these extremes, however, there are
many varieties of horses, possessing more or
less of the Arabian characteristics mingled with
those of other races. Some of the best American
horses are numbered among these mixed races,
and, by many, are considered an improvement
upon the Arabian, as they are excellent for
light carriages and buggies. The more they
resemble the Oriental steed, the better they are
for the saddle.</p>

<p>The lady who, in this country, cannot find a
horse to suit her, will, indeed, be difficult to
please. It will be best for her to tell some
gentleman what sort of horse she wishes, and
let him select for her; but, at the same time,
it can do no harm, and may prove a great advantage
to her to know all the requisite points
of a good saddle-horse. It will not take long
to learn them, and the knowledge gained will
prevent her from being imposed upon by the
ignorant or unscrupulous. Gentlemen, even
those who consider themselves good judges of
horse-flesh, are sometimes guilty of very serious
blunders in selecting a horse for a lady's use;
and should the lady be obliged to negotiate directly
with a horse-dealer, she must bear in
mind constantly the fact that, although there
are reliable and honorable dealers to be found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
there are many who would not scruple to cheat
even a woman. A careful perusal of the present
work, together with the advice of an <i>upright</i>
and <i>trustworthy</i> veterinary surgeon, or a
skilled riding-master, will aid her in protecting
herself from the impositions of unprincipled
horse-jockeys and self-styled "veterinary doctors."</p>

<p>In any case, whatever be the other characteristics
of the animal selected, be sure that he has
the oblique shoulder, as well as depth of shoulder,
and hind-legs well bent. Without these
characteristics he will be unfit for a lady's use,
as his movements will be rough and unsafe, and
the saddle will be apt to turn.</p>

<p>If it be desired to purchase a horse for a moderate
price, certain points which might be insisted
on in a high-priced animal will have to
be dispensed with; for instance, his color may
not be satisfactory; he may not have a pretty
head, or a well-set tail, etc., but these deficiencies
may be overlooked if he be sound, have
good action, and no vices. He may be handsome,
well-actioned, and thoroughly trained,
but have a slight defect in his wind, noticeable
only when he is urged into a rapid trot, or a
gallop. If wanted for street and park service
only, and if the purchaser does not care for fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
riding, a horse of this sort will suit her very
well. Sometimes a horse of good breed, as well
as of good form, has never had the advantages
of a thorough training, or he may be worn out
by excessive work. Should he be comparatively
young, rest and proper training may still make
a good horse of him, but great care should be
taken to assure one's self that no permanent
disease or injury exists. The Orientals have a
proverb, that it is well to bear in mind when
buying an animal of the kind just described:&mdash;"Ruin,
son of ruin, is he who buys to cure."</p>

<p>Always examine with great care a horse's
mouth. A hard-mouthed animal is a very unpleasant
one for a lady to ride, and is apt to
degenerate into a runaway. Scars at the angles
of the mouth are good indications of a "bolter,"
or runaway, or at least of cruel treatment, and
harsh usage is by no means a good instructor.</p>

<p>While a very short-backed horse does not appear
to great advantage under a side-saddle, he
may, nevertheless, have many good qualities
that will compensate for this defect, and it may
be overlooked provided the price asked for him
be reasonable; but horses of this kind frequently
command a high price when their action
is exceptionally good. Corns on the feet
generally depreciate the value of a horse, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
they may sometimes be cured by removing
the shoes, and giving him a free run of six
or eight months in a pasture of soft ground; if
he be then properly shod, and used on country
roads only, he may become permanently serviceable.
There is, however, considerable risk
in buying a horse that has corns, and the purchaser
should remember the Oriental proverb
just referred to, and not forget the veterinary
surgeon.</p>

<p>Before paying for a horse, the lady should
insist upon having him on trial for at least a
month, that she may have an opportunity of
discovering his vices or defects, if any such exist.
She must be careful not to condemn him
too hastily, and should, when trying him, make
due allowance for his change of quarters and
also for the novelty of carrying a new rider, as
some horses are very nervous until they become
well acquainted with their riders. Should the
horse's movements prove rough, should he be
found hard-mouthed, or should any indications
of unsoundness or viciousness be detected, he
should be immediately returned to his owner.
It must be remembered, however, that very few
horses are perfect, and that minor defects may,
in most instances, be overlooked if the essentials
are secured. Before rejecting the horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the lady should also be very sure that the faults
to which she objects are not due to her own
mismanagement of him. But if she decides
that she is not at fault, no amount of persuasion
should induce her to purchase. In justice
to the owner of the horse, he ought to be reasonably
paid for the time and services of his
rejected animal; but if it be decided to keep
the horse, then only the purchase-money originally
agreed upon should be paid.</p>

<p>The surest and best way of securing a good
saddle-horse is to purchase, from one of the celebrated
breeding farms, a well-shaped four-year-old
colt of good breed, and have him taught
the gaits and style of movement required.
Great care should be taken in the selection of
his teacher, for if the colt's temper be spoiled
by injudicious treatment, he will be completely
ruined for a lady's use. A riding-school teacher
will generally understand all the requirements
necessary for a lady's saddle-horse, and may be
safely intrusted with the animal's education.
If no riding-school master of established reputation
as a trainer can be had, it may be possible
to secure the services of some one near the
lady's home, as she can then superintend the
colt's education herself and be sure that he is
treated neither rashly nor cruelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The ideas concerning the education of the horse
have completely changed within the last twenty-five
years. The whip as a means of punishment
is entirely dispensed with in the best
training schools of the present day, and, instead
of rough and brutal measures, kindness, firmness,
and patience are now the only means employed
to train and govern him. The theory
of this modern system of training may be found
in the following explanation of a celebrated
English trainer, who subdued his horses by exhibiting
towards them a wonderful degree of
patience:&mdash;"If I enter into a contest with the
horse, he will fling and prance, and there will
be no knowing which will be master; whereas
if I remain quiet and determined, I have the
best of it."</p>

<p>The following is an example of the patience
with which this man carried out his theory:&mdash;</p>

<p>Being once mounted on a very obstinate colt
that refused to move in the direction desired,
he declined all suggestions of severe measures,
and after one or two gentle but fruitless attempts
to make the animal move, he desisted,
and having called for his pipe, sat there quietly
for a couple of hours enjoying a good smoke,
and chatting gayly with passing friends. Then
after another quiet but unsuccessful attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to induce the colt to move, he sent for some
dinner which he ate while still on the animal's
back. As night approached and the air became
cool, he sent for his overcoat and more tobacco,
and proceeded to make a night of it. About
this time the colt became uneasy, but not until
midnight did he show any disposition to move
in the required direction. Now was the time
for the master to assert himself. "Whoa!" he
cried, "you have stayed here so long to please
yourself, now you will stay a little longer to
please me." He then kept the colt standing
in the same place an hour longer, and when
he finally allowed him to move, it was in a
direction opposite to that which the colt seemed
disposed to take. He walked the animal slowly
for five miles, then allowed him to trot back to
his stable, and finally&mdash;as if he had been a
disobedient child&mdash;sent him supperless to bed,
giving him the rest of the night in which to
meditate upon the effects of his obstinacy.</p>

<p>To some this may seem a great deal of useless
trouble to take with a colt that might have
been compelled to move more promptly by
means of whip or spur; but that day's experience
completely subdued the colt's stubborn
spirit, and all idea of rebellion to human authority
was banished from his mind forever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Had a contrary course been pursued, it would
probably have made the creature headstrong,
balky, and unreliable; he would have yielded
to the whip and spur at one time only to battle
the more fiercely against them at the first favorable
opportunity, and his master would never
have known at what minute he might have to
enter into a contest with him. That a horse
trained by violent means can never be trusted
is a fact which is every day becoming better
recognized and appreciated.</p>

<p>"A great many accidents might be avoided,"
says a well-known authority upon the education
of the horse, "could the populace be instructed
to think a horse was endowed with senses, was
gifted with feelings, and was able in some degree
to appreciate motives."... "The strongest
man cannot physically contend against the
weakest horse. Man's power reposes in better
attributes than any which reside in thews and
muscles. Reason alone should dictate and control
his conduct. Thus guided, mortals have
subdued the elements. For power, when mental,
is without limit: by savage violence nothing
is attained and man is often humbled."</p>

<p>The lady who has the good fortune to live in
the country where she can have so many opportunities
for studying the disposition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
character of her animals, and can, if she chooses,
watch and superintend the education of her
horse from the time he is a colt, has undoubtedly
a better chance of securing a fine saddle-horse
than she who lives in the city and is
obliged to depend almost entirely upon others
for the training of her horse. Indeed, very little
formal training will be necessary for a horse
that has been brought up under the eye of a
kind and judicious mistress, for he will soon
learn to understand and obey the wishes of one
whom he loves and trusts, and if she be an accomplished
rider she can do the greater part of
the training herself.</p>

<p>The best and most trustworthy horse the author
ever had was one that was trained almost
from his birth. Fay's advent was a welcome
event to the children of the family, by whom
he was immediately claimed and used as a play-fellow.
By the older members of the family he
was always regarded as part of the household,&mdash;an
honored servant, to be well cared for,&mdash;and
he was petted and fondled by all, from
paterfamilias down to Bridget in the kitchen.
He was taught, among other tricks, to bow
politely when anything nice was given him,
and many were the journeys he made around
to the kitchen window, where he would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
his obeisance in such an irresistible manner that
Bridget would be completely captivated; and
the dainty bits were passed through the window
in such quantities and were swallowed with
such avidity that the lady of the house had to
interfere and restrict the donations to two cakes
daily.</p>

<p>Fay had been taught to shake hands with
his admirers, and this trick was called his "word
of honor;" he had his likes and dislikes, and
would positively refuse to honor some people
with a hand-shake. If these slighted individuals
insisted upon riding him, he made them
so uncomfortable by the roughness of his gaits
that they never cared to repeat the experiment.
But the favored ones, whom he had received
into his good graces and to whom he had given
his "word of honor," he would carry safely
anywhere, at his lightest and easiest gait. Fay
never went back on his word, which is more
than can be said of some human beings.</p>

<p>The great difficulty in training a horse for a
lady's use is to get him well placed on his
haunches. In Fay's case this was accomplished
by teaching him to place his fore-feet upon a
stout inverted tub, about two feet high. When
he offered his "hand" for a shake, some one
pushed forward the tub, upon which his "foot"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dropped and was allowed to remain a short
time, when the other foot was treated in the
same manner. After half a dozen lessons of this
sort, he learned to put up his feet without assistance;
first one, and then the other, and,
finally, both at once. These performances were
always rewarded by a piece of apple or cake,
together with expressions of pleasure from the
by-standers. Fay had a weakness for flattery,
and no actor called before the curtain ever expressed
more pleasure at an <i>encore</i> than did Fay
when applauded for his efforts to please. That
the tub trick would prove equally effectual with
other horses in teaching them to place themselves
well on their haunches cannot be positively
stated. It might prove more troublesome
to teach most horses this trick than to
have them placed upon their haunches in the
usual way by means of a strong curb, or by
lessons with the lunge line. It proved entirely
successful in Fay's case, and a horse lighter in
hand or easier in gait was never ridden by a
woman.</p>

<p>Fay's training began when he was only a few
weeks old: a light halter and a loose calico surcingle
were placed on him for a short time each
day, during which time he was carefully watched
lest he should do himself some injury. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
he was about eight months old, a small bit, made
of a smooth stick of licorice, was put into his
mouth, and to this bit light leather reins were
fastened by pieces of elastic rubber: this rubber
relieved his mouth from a constant dead pull,
and tended to preserve its delicate sensibility.
Thus harnessed he was led around the lawn,
followed by a crowd of youthful admirers and
playmates, who formed a sort of triumphal procession,
with which the colt was as well pleased
as the spectators. Every attempt on his part
to indulge in horse-play, such as biting, kicking,
etc., was always quickly checked, and no one
was allowed to tease or strike him.</p>

<p>Nothing heavier than a dumb jockey was put
on his back until he was four years old, when
his education began in sober earnest. After a
few lessons with the lunge line, given by a regular
trainer, a saddle was put on his back,
and for the first time in his life he carried a
human being.</p>

<p>When learning his different riding gaits on
the road, he was always accompanied by a well-trained
saddle-horse, aided by whose example
as well as by the efforts of his rider he was soon
trained in three different styles of movement,
namely, a good walk, trot, and hand gallop.
Fear seemed unknown to this horse, for he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
always been allowed as a colt to follow his dam
on the road, and had thus become so accustomed
to all such alarming objects as steam engines,
hay carts, etc., that they had ceased to
occasion him the least uneasiness. This high
spirited and courageous animal had perfect confidence
in the world and looked upon all mankind
as friendly. His constant companionship
with human beings had sharpened his perceptive
faculties, and made him quick to understand
whatever was required of him. The
kindness shown him was never allowed to degenerate
into weakness or over-indulgence, and
whenever anything was required of him it was
insisted upon until complete obedience was obtained.
In this way he was taught to understand
that man was his master and superior.</p>

<p>Although it is not absolutely essential that a
lady's horse should learn the tricks of bowing,
hand-shaking, etc., yet the lady who will take
the pains to teach her horse some of them will
find that she not only gets a great deal of pleasure
from the lessons, but that they enable her
to gain more complete control over him, for the
horse, like some other animals, gives affection
and entire obedience to the person who makes
an effort to increase his intelligence.</p>

<p>Lessons with the lunge line should always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
short, as they are very fatiguing to a young
colt, and when given too often or for too great
a length of time they make him giddy from
rush of blood to the head; not a few instances,
indeed, have occurred where a persistence in
such lessons has occasioned complete blindness.</p>

<p>A lady's horse should be taught to disregard
the flapping of the riding-skirt, and it is also
well for him to become accustomed to having
articles of various kinds, such as pieces of cloth,
paper, etc., fluttering about him, as he will not
then be likely to take fright should any part
of the rider's costume become disarranged and
blow about him.</p>

<p>He should also be so trained that he will not
mind having the saddle moved from side to side
on his back. The best of riders may have her
saddle turn, and if the horse be thus trained he
will neither kick nor run away should such an
accident occur.</p>

<p>It is also very important that the horse should
be taught to stop, and stand as firm as a rock
at the word of command given in a low, firm
tone. This habit is not only important in
mounting and dismounting,&mdash;feats which it is
difficult, if not impossible, for the lady to perform
unless the horse be perfectly still,&mdash;but
the rider will also find this prompt obedience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
great assistance in checking her horse when he
becomes frightened and tries to break away;
for he will stop instinctively when he hears the
familiar order given in the voice to which he is
accustomed.</p>

<p>A lady should not fail to visit her horse's
stable from time to time, in order to assure herself
that he is well treated and properly cared
for by the groom. Viciousness and restlessness
on the road can often be traced to annoyances
and ill-treatment in the stable. Grooms and
stable boys sometimes like to see the horse kick
out and attempt to bite, and will while away
their idle hours in harassing him, tickling his
ears with straws, or touching him up with the
whip in order to make him prance and strike
out. The result of these annoyances will be
that, if the lady during her ride accidentally
touches her horse with the whip, he will begin
prancing and kicking; or, if it is summer time,
the gnats and flies swarming about his ears
will make him unmanageable. In the latter
case, ear-tips will only make the matter worse,
especially if they have dangling tassels. When
such signs of nervousness are noticeable, especially
in a horse that has been hitherto gentle,
they may usually be attributed to the treatment
of the groom or his assistants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Most grooms delight in currying their charges
with combs having teeth like small spikes and
in laying on the polishing brush with a hand as
heavy as the blows of misfortune. Some animals,
it is true, like this kind of rubbing, but
there are many, who have thin, delicate skins,
to whom such treatment is almost unmitigated
torture. Should the lady hear any contest
going on between the horse and groom during
the former's morning toilette, she should order
a blunt curry-comb to be used; or even dispense
with a comb altogether, and let the brush
only be applied with a light hand. Grooms
sometimes take pleasure in throwing cold water
over their horses. In very warm weather, and
when the animal is not overheated, this treatment
may prove refreshing to him, but, as a
general rule it is objectionable, as it is apt to
occasion a sudden chill which may result in
serious consequences.</p>

<p>The stable man may grumble at the lady's
interference and supervision, but she must not
allow this to prevent her from attending carefully
to the welfare of the animal whose faithful
services contribute so largely to her pleasure.
When she buys a horse she introduces a new
member into her household, who should be as
well looked after and cared for as any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
faithful servant or friend. Indeed, the horse is
the more entitled to consideration in that he is
entirely helpless, and his lot for good or evil
lies wholly in her power. If the mistress is
careless or neglects her duty, the servants in
whose charge the horse is placed will be very
apt to follow her example, and the poor animal
will suffer accordingly.</p>

<p>Perhaps the lady, however, may object to
entering the stable, and agree with the groom
in thinking it "no place for a woman." Or
she may fear that in carrying out the ideas
suggested above she will expose herself to the
ridicule of thoughtless acquaintances who can
never do anything until it has received the
sanction of fashion.</p>

<p>For the benefit of this fastidious individual
and her timid friends we will quote the example
of the Empress of Austria, who, although occupying
an exalted position at a court where etiquette
is carried to the extremes of formality,
yet does not hesitate to visit the stable of her
favorite steeds and personally to supervise their
welfare; and woe to the perverse groom who
in the least particular disobeys her commands.</p>

<p>Many other examples might be given of
high-born ladies, such as Queen Victoria, the
Princess of Wales, the Princess of Prussia, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
others, who do not seem to consider it at all unfeminine
or coarse for a woman to give some
personal care and supervision to her horses.
But to enter into more details would prove tiresome,
and the example given is enough to silence
the scruples of the followers of fashion.</p>

<p>Like all herbivorous creatures that love to
roam in herds, the horse is naturally of a restless
temperament. Activity is the delight of
his existence, and when left to nature and a
free life he is seldom quiet. Man takes this
creature of buoyant nature from the freedom of
its natural life, and confines the active body in
a prison house where its movements are even
more circumscribed than are those of the wild
beasts in the menagerie; they can at least turn
around and walk from side to side in their cages,
but the horse in his narrow stall is able only to
move his head from side to side, to paw a little
with his fore-feet, and to move backwards and
forwards a short distance, varying with the
length of his halter; when he lies down to sleep
he is compelled to keep in one position, and
runs the risk of meeting with some serious accident.
In some stables where the grooms delight
in general stagnation, the horses under
their charge are not allowed to indulge in even
the smallest liberty. The slightest movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
is punished by the lash of these silence-loving
tyrants, in whose opinion the horse has enough
occupation and excitement in gazing at the
blank boards directly in front of his head. If
these boards should happen to be whitewashed,
as is often the case in the country, constant
gazing at them will be almost sure to give rise
to shying, or even to occasion blindness. If the
reader will, for several minutes, gaze steadily
at a white wall, she will he able to get some
idea of the poor horse's sensations.</p>

<p>Is it then to be wondered at, that an animal
of an excitable nature like the horse should,
when released from the oppressive quiescence
of his prison-house, act as if bereft of reason,
and perform strange antics and caperings in
his insane delight at once more breathing the
fresh air, and seeing the outside world. But,
while the horse is thus expressing his pleasure
and recovering the use of limbs by vigorous
kicks, or is expending his superfluous
energy by bounding out of the road at every
strange object he encounters, the saddle will be
neither a safe nor pleasant place for the lady
rider. To avoid such danger, and to compensate,
in some degree, the liberty-loving animal
for depriving him of his natural life and placing
him in bondage, he should be given, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the usual narrow stall, a box stall, measuring
about sixteen or eighteen feet square. In this
box the horse should be left entirely free, without
even a halter, as this appendage has sometimes
been the cause of fearful accidents, by
becoming entangled with the horse's feet.</p>

<p>The groom may grumble again at this innovation,
because a box stall means more work
for him, but if he really cares for the horses
under his charge he will soon become reconciled
to the small amount of extra work required by
the use of a box stall. Every one who knows
anything about a horse in the stable is well
aware of the injury done to this animal's feet
and limbs by compelling him to stand always
confined to one spot in a narrow stall. A box
will prevent the occurrence of these injuries,
besides giving the horse a little freedom and
enabling him to get more rest and benefit from
his sleep.</p>

<p>Some horses are fond of looking through a
window or over a half door. The glimpse they
thus get of the outside life seems to amuse and
interest them, and it can do no harm to gratify
this desire. Others, however, seem to be worried
and excited by such outlooks; they become
restless and even make attempts to leap over
the half door or through the window. In such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
cases there should, of course, be no out-of-door
scenery visible from the box.</p>

<p>The groom should exercise the horse daily,
in a gentle and regular manner; an hour or
two of walking, varied occasionally by a short
trot, will generally be found sufficient. Being
self-taught in the art of riding, grooms nearly
always have a very heavy bridle hand, and, if
allowed to use the curb bit, will soon destroy
that sensitiveness of the horse's mouth which
adds so much to the pleasure of riding him.
The man who exercises the horse should not be
permitted to wear spurs; a lady's horse should
be guided wholly by the whip and reins,&mdash;as
will be explained hereafter,&mdash;and in no case
whatever should the spur be used. If the lady
wishes to keep her horse in good health and
temper she must insist upon his being exercised
regularly, and must assure herself that the
groom executes her orders faithfully; for some
men, while professing to obey, have been known
to stop at the nearest public house, and, after
spending an hour or two in drinking beer and
gossiping with acquaintances, to ride back complacently
to the stable, leaving the horse to
suffer from want of exercise. Other grooms
have gone to the opposite extreme, and have
ridden so hard and fast that the horse on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
return was completely tired out, so that when
there was occasion to use him the same day it
was an effort for him to maintain his usual
light gait. Grooms who are always doctoring
a horse, giving him nostrums that do no good
but often much harm, are also to be avoided. In
short, the owner of a horse must be prepared
for tricks of all kinds on the part of these stable
servants; although, in justice to them, it must
be said that there are many who endeavor to
perform all their duties faithfully, and can be
relied on to treat with kindness any animals
committed to their care.</p>

<p>Should the lady rider be obliged to get her
horse from a livery stable, she should not rely
entirely upon what his owner says of his gaits
or gentleness, but should have him tried carefully
by some friend or servant, before herself
attempting to mount him. She should also be
very careful to see, or have her escort see, that
the saddle is properly placed upon the back of
the horse and firmly girthed, so that there may
be no danger of its turning.</p>

<h3>THE RIDING HABIT.</h3>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her dress, her shape, her matchless grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all observed, as well as heavenly face."<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="citation"><span class="smcap">Dryden.</span></p>
</div></div>


<p>A riding habit should be distinguished by its
perfect simplicity. All attempts at display, such
as feathers, ribbons, glaring gilt buttons, and
sparkling jet, should be carefully avoided, and
the dress should be noticeable only for the fineness
of its material and the elegance of its fit.</p>

<p>One of the first requirements in a riding
dress is that it should fit smoothly and easily.
The sleeves should be rather loose, especially
near the arm-holes, so that the arms may move
freely; but should fit closely enough at the
wrist to allow long gauntlet gloves to pass
readily over them. It is essential that ample
room should be allowed across the chest, as the
shoulders are thrown somewhat back in riding,
and the chest is, consequently, expanded. The
neck of the dress should fit very easily, especially
at the back part. Care must be taken
not to make the waist too long, for, owing to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lady's position in the saddle, the movements of
her horse will soon make a long waist wrinkle
and look inelegant. To secure ease, together
with a perfect fit without crease or fold, will be
somewhat difficult, but not impossible. Some
tailors, particularly in New York, Philadelphia,
London, and Paris, make a specialty of ladies'
riding costumes, and can generally be relied on
to supply comfortable and elegant habits.</p>

<p>The favorite and most appropriate style of
<b>riding jacket</b> is the "postilion basque;" this
should be cut short over the hips, and is then
especially becoming to a plump person, as it
diminishes the apparent width of the back below
the waist. The front should have two
small darts, and should extend about three
inches below the waist; it should then slope
gradually up to the hips,&mdash;where it must be
shortest,&mdash;and then downward so as to form a
short, square coat-flap at the back, below the
waist. This flap must be made without gathers
or plaits, and lined with silk, between which
and the cloth some stiffening material should
be inserted. The middle seam of the coat-flap
should be left open as far as the waist, where
about one inch of it must be lapped over from
left to right; the short side-form on each side
must be lapped a little toward the central unclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
seam. The arm-holes should be cut rather
high on the shoulders, so that the back may
look less broad. If the lady lacks plumpness
and roundness, her jacket must be made double-breasted,
or else have padding placed across the
bust, for a hollow chest mars all the beauty of
the figure in the saddle, and causes the rider to
look round-shouldered. The edge of the basque
should be trimmed with cord-braid, and the
front fastened with crocheted bullet buttons;
similar buttons should be used to fasten the
sleeves closely at the wrist, and two more should
be placed on the back of the basque just at its
waist line.</p>

<p>Great care must be taken to have the jacket
well lined and its seams strongly sewed. The
coat-flaps on the back of the basque, below the
waist-line, should be held down by heavy metallic
buttons, sewed underneath each flap at its
lower part, and covered with the same material
as that of the dress. Without these weights this
part of the dress will be apt to be blown out of
position by every passing breeze, and will bob
up and down with every motion of the rider's
body, presenting a most ridiculous appearance.</p>

<p>For winter riding an extra jacket may be
worn over the riding basque. It should be
made of some heavy, warm material, and fit half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
tightly. If trimmed with good fur, this jacket
makes a very handsome addition to the riding
habit.</p>

<p>Poets have expatiated upon the grace and
beauty of the long, flowing riding skirt, with its
ample folds, but experience has taught that
this long skirt, though, perhaps, very poetical,
is practically not only inconvenient but positively
dangerous. In the canter or gallop the
horse is very apt to entangle his hind-foot in it
and be thrown, when the rider may consider
herself fortunate if she escapes with no worse
accident than a torn skirt. Another objection to
this poetical skirt is, that it gathers up the mud
and dust of the road, and soon presents a most
untidy appearance; while if the day be fresh
and breezy its ample folds will stream out like
a victorious banner; if made of some light material
the breeze will swell it out like an inflated
balloon; and if of heavy cloth its length will
envelop the rider's feet, and make her look as if
tied in a bag.</p>

<p>To avoid all these dangers and inconveniences
the <b>riding skirt</b> should be cut rather short and
narrow, and be made of some heavy material.
Two yards and a quarter will be quite wide
enough for the bottom of the skirt, while the
length need be only about twelve inches more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
than the rider's ordinary dress. The skirt
should be so gored as to form no gathers or
plaits at the waist. Tailor-made skirts are so
neatly gored as to remain perfectly smooth
when the rider is seated in the saddle. As the
pommels take up a good deal of room, the front
part of the skirt, which passes over them, should
be made a little longer than the back, so that,
when the rider is seated in the saddle, her dress
may hang evenly. If made the same length all
around it will, when the lady is mounted, be
entirely too short in front, and, besides presenting
an uneven, trail-like appearance, will be apt
to work back, or to blow up and expose the
right foot of the wearer.</p>

<p>The bottom of the skirt should have a hem
about three inches wide, but should never be
faced with leather, as this will give a stiff, bungling
effect, and if the rider should be thrown,
and catch the hem of her skirt on either pommel
or stirrup, the strength of the leather lining
would prevent the cloth from tearing and thus
releasing her. Shot, pieces of lead, or other
hard substances are also objectionable, because
by striking against the horse's side they often
cause him to become restless or even to run
away. To keep the skirt down in its proper
position a loop of stout elastic, or tape, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
be fastened underneath, near the bottom, and
through this loop the foot should be passed before
being put into the stirrup. The point
where the loop should be fastened must be determined
by the position of the lady's foot when
she is correctly seated in the saddle. Some
riders use a second elastic for the right foot, to
prevent the skirt from slipping back, but this
is not absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The basque and skirt should be made separate,
although it is a very good plan to have
strong hooks and eyes to fasten them together
at the sides and back, as this will prevent the
skirt from turning, or slipping down below the
waist, should the binding be a little too loose.
The placket-hole should be on the left side and
should be buttoned over, to prevent it from
gaping open; it must be only just large enough
to allow the skirt to slip readily over the shoulders.</p>

<p>The best material for a riding habit is broadcloth,
or any strong, soft fabric that will adapt
itself readily to the figure. The color is, of
course, a matter of taste. Black is always stylish,
and is particularly becoming to a stout
person. Dark blue, hunter's green, and dark
brown are also becoming colors, especially for
slender, youthful figures. In the country, a linen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
jacket may be worn in warm weather, and will
be found a very agreeable substitute for the
cloth basque, but the skirt should never be
made of so thin a material, as it will be too
light to hang well and too slippery to sit upon.</p>

<p>To secure ease and freedom in the saddle, a
garment closely resembling a pair of <b>pantaloons</b>
will have to be worn under the riding skirt, and
be fastened down securely by means of strong
leather or rubber straps, which pass under the
foot and are buttoned to the bottom of the pantaloons.
These pantaloons should be made of
some soft cloth the color of the dress, or else of
chamois skin, faced up to the knee with cloth
like that of the skirt. Most people prefer the
chamois skin for winter use, as it is very warm
and so soft that it prevents much of the chafing
usually occasioned by the rubbing of the right
leg on the pommel.</p>

<p>No under <b>petticoats</b> are necessary where the
pantaloons are used, but if the rider wear one,
it should be of some dark color that will not attract
attention if the riding skirt be blown back.
Black silk will be an excellent material for such
a skirt in summer, something warmer being
used in winter. This skirt should have no folds
or gathers in it, but if the rider be very thin a
little padding around the hips and over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
back will give her the desired effect of plumpness.</p>

<p>An important article of every-day wear will
have to be discarded and a <b>riding-habit shirt</b>
used in its place. This shirt must be made short,
that the rider may not have to sit upon its folds
and wrinkles, which she would find very uncomfortable.
The collar should be high and standing,
<i>à la militaire</i>, and made of the finest, whitest
linen; it should be sewed to the shirt for
greater security, and should just be seen above
the high collar band of the basque.</p>

<p>The <b>drawers</b> must also be made very much
like those of a gentleman, and the lower parts
be tucked under the hose. The garters should
be rather loose, or elastic.</p>

<p>Buttoned boots, or those with elastic sides,
should not be worn when riding. For summer
use, the shoe laced at the side, and having a low,
broad heel, is liked by many. The ladies' Wellington
boot, reaching nearly to the knee, is
also a favorite with some, and, when made without
any seam in front, prevents the stirrup-iron
from chafing the instep. To be comfortable, it
should have a broad sole and be made a little
longer than the foot. This boot, however, gives
the wearer rather an Amazonian appearance,
and has also the great disadvantage of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
very difficult to get off, the lady usually being
obliged to appropriate the gentleman's bootjack
for the purpose. The <b>best boot</b> for riding purposes,
found to be the most comfortable, and
one easy to get on and off, is made of some light
leather, or kid, for summer use, and of heavier
leather for winter; it extends half way to the
knee, laces up in front, has broad, low heels and
wide soles, and is made a little longer than the
wearer's foot, so that it may be perfectly easy,
as a tight boot in riding is even more distressing
than in walking.</p>

<p>The <b>corset</b> is indispensable to the elegant fit
required in a riding habit, but should never be
laced tight. It should be short on the sides and
in the front and back. If long in front it will
be almost impossible for the rider to pass her
knee over the second pommel when she attempts
to mount her horse, and will cause her,
when riding, to incline her body too far back;
when long at the sides it will be even more inconvenient,
for, if at all tight, it will make the
rider, when in the saddle, feel as if her hips were
compressed in a vise; when too long behind, it
will interfere with that curving or hollowing in
of the back that is so necessary to an erect position;
it will also tend to throw the body too far
forward. If the rider have any tendency to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
stoutness all these discomforts will be exaggerated.
The C. P. or the Parisian <i>la Sirene</i> is undoubtedly
the best corset for riding purposes,
for it is short, light, and flexible, and not prejudicial
to the ease and elegance of good riding,
as is the case with the stiff, long-bodied corset.</p>

<p>The <b>hair</b> should be so arranged that it cannot
possibly come down during the ride. To
effect this, it must be made into one long braid,
which must be coiled upon the back of the head,
and fastened firmly, but not too tightly, by
means of a few long hairpins. The coil may
be put on the top of the head, but this arrangement
will be found very inconvenient, especially
where the hair is thick, for it will make the hat
sit very awkwardly on the head. The hair
should never be worn in ringlets, as these will
be blown about by the wind, or by the movements
of the rider, and will soon become so tangled
as to look like anything but the "smooth
flowing ringlets" of the poet. Nor should the
hair be allowed to stream down the back in long
peasant-braids, a style mistakenly adopted by
some young misses, but which gives the rider
a wild and untidy appearance. When the horse
is in motion these braids will stream out on the
breeze, and an observer at a short distance will
be puzzled to know what it is that seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in such an extraordinary state of agitation. It
is also a mistake to draw the hair back tightly
from the forehead, as this gives a constrained
look to the features; it should, on the contrary,
be arranged in rather a loose, unstudied manner,
which will tend to soften the expression of
the face. It is the extreme of bad taste to bang
or frizz the hair across the forehead, or to wear
the hat somewhat on the back of the head.
These things are sometimes done by very young
girls, but give to the prettiest and most modest
face an air of boldness and vulgarity.</p>

<p>The <b>riding hat</b> at present fashionable, and
most suitable for city or park, is made of black
silk plush with a Stanley curved brim, and bell-crown,
and is trimmed with a narrow band
around the crown, directly above the brim.
Another favorite is a jockey-cap, made of the
same cloth as that of the habit. Either of these
may be obtained at the hat stores. For riding
in the country, where one does not care to be
so dressy, the English Derby, or some other
fashionable style of young gentleman's felt hat,
may be used; with a short plume or bird's wing
fastened at the side, a hat of this description
has a very charming and coquettish air. There
is another style of silk hat manufactured expressly
for ladies, which may also be obtained at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
any hatter's; it has a lower crown than a gentleman's
silk hat, and looks very pretty with a
short black net-veil fastened around the crown,
as this relieves the stiff look it otherwise presents.
This style of hat is very appropriate for
a middle-aged person. Care must be taken to
have the hat neither too loose nor too tight; if
too tight, it will be apt to occasion a headache,
and if too loose will be easily displaced.</p>

<p>Long veils, long plumes, hats with very broad
brims, or very high crowns, as well as those
which are worn perched on the top of the
head, should be especially avoided. The hat
must always be made secure on the head by
means of stout elastic sewn on strongly, and so
adjusted that it can pass below the braid or coil
of hair at the back of the head. An ordinary
back-comb firmly fastened on the top of the
head will prevent the hat from gradually slipping
backwards.</p>

<p>These apparently trifling details must be attended
to, or some prankish breeze will suddenly
carry off the rider's hat, and she will be subjected
to the mortification of having it handed
back to her, with an ill-concealed smile, by some
obliging pedestrian. Many little particulars
which seem insignificant when in the dressing-room
will become causes of much discomfort and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
suffering when in the saddle. The pleasure
of many a ride has been marred by a displaced
pin, a lost button, too tight a garter, a glove
that cramped the hand, or a ring that occasioned
swelling and pain in the finger. These
details, unimportant as they may seem, must be
carefully attended to before starting for a ride.
Pins should be used sparingly. If a watch is
worn, it should be well secured in its pocket,
and the chain carefully fastened to a button of
the jacket.</p>

<p>The <b>riding gauntlets</b> should be made of
thick, soft, undressed kid, or chamois skin, be
long wristed, and somewhat loose across the
hands, so that the reins may be firmly grasped.
With the exception of the watch, the chain of
which should be as unostentatious as possible, it
will not be in good taste to wear jewelry. A
cravat or small bow of ribbon will be in much
better taste than a breast-pin for fastening the
collar, and may be of any color that suits the
fancy or complexion of the wearer. The costume
may be much brightened by a small <i>boutonnière</i>
of natural flowers; these placed at the
throat or waist in an apparently careless manner
give an air of daintiness and refinement to the
whole costume.</p>

<p>There is one accomplishment often neglected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
or overlooked, even by the most skillful lady
riders, and that is, expertness in <b>holding the
riding skirt</b> easily and gracefully when not in
the saddle. In this attainment the Parisian
horsewoman far excels all others; her manner
of gathering up the folds of her riding skirt,
while waiting for her horse, forms a picture of
such unaffected elegance, that it would be well
for other riders to study and imitate it. She
does not grab her skirt with one hand, twist it
round to one side, allow it to trail upon the
ground, nor does she collect the folds in one unwieldy
bunch and throw it brusquely over her
arm. Instead of any of these ungraceful acts,
she quietly extends her arms down to their full
length at her sides, inclines her body slightly
forward, and gathers up the front of her skirt,
raising her hands just far enough to allow the
long part in front and at the sides to escape the
ground; then by bringing her hands slightly
forward, one being held a little higher than the
other, the back part of the skirt is raised.
While accomplishing these movements her whip
will be held carelessly in her right hand, at a
very short distance below the handle, the point
being directed downwards, and somewhat obliquely
backwards. The whole of this graceful
man&oelig;uvring will be effected readily and artlessly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in an apparently unstudied manner. In
reality, however, all the Parisian's ease and
grace are the results of careful training, but so
perfect is the instruction that art is made to
appear like nature.</p>

<p>In selecting a <b>riding whip</b> care should be
taken to secure one that is straight and stiff;
if it be curved, it may accidentally touch the
horse and make him restless; if flexible it will
be of no use in managing him. The handle of
the whip may be very plain, or the lady may
indulge her taste for the ornamental by having
it very elaborate and rich, but she should be
careful never to sacrifice strength to appearances.
Any projecting points that might catch
on the dress and tear it must be dispensed with.
That the whip may not be lost if the hand should
unwittingly lose its hold upon it, a loop of silk
cord should be fastened firmly to the handle,
and the hand passed through this loop. When
riding, the whip should always be held in the
right hand with a grasp sufficient to retain it,
but not as if in a vise; the point should be directed
downward, or toward the hind-leg of the
horse, care being taken not to touch him with
it except when necessary.</p>

<p>In ye ancient times, the damsel who wished
to enjoy horseback riding did not, like her successor
of to-day, trust to her own ability to ride
and manage her horse, but, seated upon a pad
or cushion, called a "pillion," which was fastened
behind a man's saddle, rode without a
stirrup and without troubling herself with the
reins, preserving her balance by holding to the
belt of a trusty page, or masculine admirer,
whose duty it was to attend to the management
of the horse. We learn that as late as <span class="smaller">A. D.</span>
1700, George III. made his entry into London
with his wife, Charlotte, thus seated behind him.
Gradually, however, as women became more
confident, they rode alone upon a sort of side-saddle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
on which by means of the reins and by
bracing her feet against a board, called a "planchette,"
which was fastened to the front of the
saddle, the rider managed to keep her seat.
Such was the English horsewoman of the seventeenth
century, in the time of Charles II.,&mdash;"the
height of fashion and the cream of style."</p>

<p>To the much quoted "vanity of the fair sex"
do we owe the invention of the side-saddle of
our grandmothers. About the middle of the
sixteenth century Catherine de Medici, wife of
Henry II. of France, having a very symmetrical
figure which she wished to display to advantage,
invented the second pommel of the saddle,
and thus, while gratifying her own vanity, was
unconsciously the means of greatly benefiting
her sex by enabling them to ride with more
ease and freedom. To this saddle there was
added, about 1830, a third pommel, the invention
of which is due to the late M. Pellier, Sr.,
an eminent riding teacher in Paris, France.
This three-pommeled saddle is now called the
<b>English saddle</b>, and is the one generally used
by the best lady riders of the present day.</p>

<p>This so-called "English saddle" was promptly
appreciated, and wherever introduced soon supplanted
the old-fashioned one with only two
pommels. (<a href="#Fig_7" class="inref">Fig. 7.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>A lady who has once ridden one of these
three-pommeled saddles will never care to use
any other kind. It renders horseback riding
almost perfectly safe, for, if the rider has learned
to use it properly, it will be nearly impossible
for a horse to throw her. It gives her a much
firmer seat even than that of a gentleman in his
saddle, and at the same time, if rightly used,
does not interfere with that easy grace so essential
to good riding. In many of our large cities
where this saddle is employed twenty lady riders
may now be seen in the park or on the road
where formerly there was one; and this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wholly due to the sense of security it gives, especially
to a timid rider, a feeling never attainable
in the two-pommeled saddle, where the seat
is maintained chiefly by the balance, or by using
the reins as a means of support.</p>

<p>By sitting erect, taking a firm hold upon the
second pommel with the right knee, and pressing
the left knee up against the third pommel,
a perfectly secure seat is obtained, from which
the rider cannot be shaken, provided the saddle
is well girthed and the horse does not fall, while
her hands are left free to manage the reins, a
very important point where the horse is spirited
or restless. To insure the greatest safety and
comfort for both horse and rider, it is very important
that the saddle should be accurately
constructed. If possible, it should be made
especially for the horse that is to carry it, so
that it may suit his particular shape. If it does
not fit him well, it will be likely to turn, or may
gall his back severely, and make him for a long
time unfit for service. It may even, in time,
give rise to fistulous withers, will certainly
make the horse restless and uneasy on the road,
and the pain he suffers will interfere with the
ease and harmony of his gaits. Many a horse
has been rendered unfit for a lady's use solely
because the saddle did not fit well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The under surface of the arch of the saddle-tree,
in front, should never come in contact
with the animal's withers, nor should the points
of the saddle-tree be so tightly fitted as to interfere
with the movements of his shoulders. On
the other hand, they should not be so far apart
as to allow the central furrowed line of the under
surface of the saddle (the chamber) to rest
upon the animal's back. The saddle should be
so fitted and padded that this central chamber
will lie directly over the spinal column of the
horse without touching it, while the padded surfaces,
just below the chamber, should rest closely
on the sides of the back, and be supported at as
many points as is possible without making the
animal uncomfortable.</p>

<p>When a horse has very high withers, a breast-plate,
similar to that employed in military service,
may be used, to prevent the saddle from
slipping backwards. This contrivance consists
of a piece of leather passing round the neck
like a collar, to the lowest part of which is fastened
a strap that passes between the fore-legs
of the horse and is attached to the saddle girth.
Two other straps, one on each side, connect the
upper part of the collar piece with the upper
part of the saddle. The under strap should
never be very loose, for should the saddle slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
back and this strap not be tight enough to hold
down the collar piece, the latter will be pulled
up by the upper straps so as to press against the
windpipe of the horse and choke him. Should
the horse have low withers and a round, barrel-like
body, false pannels or padded pieces may
be used; but an animal of this shape is not suitable
for a lady, for it will be almost impossible
to keep the saddle from turning, no matter how
carefully it may be girthed.</p>

<p>A sufficiently spacious seat or platform to the
saddle is much more comfortable for both horse
and rider than a narrow one. It gives the rider
a firmer seat, and does not bring so much strain
upon the girths. This platform should also be
made as nearly level as possible, and be covered
with quilted buckskin. Leather, now so often
used for this purpose, becomes after a time so
slippery that it is difficult to retain one's seat,
and the pommels when covered with it are apt
to chafe the limbs severely.</p>

<p>To secure a thoroughly comfortable saddle it
is necessary that not only the horse, but also
the rider, should be measured for it; for a saddle
suitable for a slender person could hardly
be used with any comfort by a stout one, and it
is almost as bad to have a saddle too large as
too small. Care must be taken to have sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
length from the front of the second pommel
to the cantle. In the ready-made saddles
this distance is usually too short, and the rider
is obliged to sit upon the back edge of the seat,
thereby injuring both herself and her horse.
It is much better to err in the other direction
and have the seat too long rather than too short.
The third pommel should be so placed that it
will just span the knee when the stirrup-leather
is of the right length. It should be rather
short, slightly curved, and blunt. If it be too
long and have too much of a curve, it will, in
the English trot, interfere with the free action
of the rider's left leg, and if the horse should
fall, it would be almost impossible for her to disengage
her leg and free herself in time to escape
injury. The third pommel must be so
placed as not to interfere with the position of
the right leg when this is placed around the
second pommel with the right heel drawn backwards.
To get the proper proportions for her
saddle, the lady must, when seated, take her
measure from the under side of the knee joint
to the lower extremity of her back, and also&mdash;to
secure the proper width for the seat&mdash;from
thigh to thigh. If these two measurements are
given to the saddle-maker he will, if he understands
his business, be able to construct the
saddle properly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The saddle recommended by the author, one
which she has used for several years, and still
continues to use, is represented in <a href="#Fig_7" class="inref">Fig. 7</a>. The
third pommel of this saddle is of medium size,
and instead of being close to the second one is
placed a short distance below it, thus enabling
the rider to use a longer stirrup than she otherwise
could; for if the two pommels be very
close together, the rider will be obliged to use
a very short stirrup in order to make this third
pommel of any use. The disadvantage of a
short stirrup is that, in a long ride, it is apt to
occasion cramp in the left leg. It also interferes
with an easy and steady position in the
saddle. But with a stirrup of the right length,
and the arrangement of the pommels such as we
have described, a steadiness is given to the left
leg that can never be obtained with the old-fashioned
two-pommeled saddle.</p>

<p>The third pommel must be screwed securely
into the saddle-tree, and once fixed in its proper
place, should not again be moved, as if frequently
turned it will soon get loose, and the
rider will not be able to rely upon its assistance
to retain her balance. It should be screwed
into place inversely, that is, instead of being
turned to the right it must be turned to the left,
so that the pressure of the knee may make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
firmer and more secure, instead of loosening it,
as would be the case if it were screwed to the
right. This pommel should be well padded, so
that the knee may not be bruised by it.</p>

<p>The second pommel should also be well padded,
and should always be curved slightly so as to
suit the form of the right leg. It must not be
so high as to render it difficult, in mounting and
dismounting, to pass the right knee over it.
The off-pommel, since the English saddle has
come into vogue, has almost disappeared, being
reduced to a mere vestige of its former size.
This is a great improvement to the rider's appearance,
as she now no longer has that confined,
cribbed-up look which the high pommeled
saddle of twenty years ago gave her.</p>

<p>The distance between the off-pommel and the
second one should be adapted to the size of the
rider's leg, being wide enough to allow the leg
to rest easily between the two; but no wider
than this, as too much space will be apt to lead
her to sit sideways upon the saddle.</p>

<p>A saddle should be well padded, but not so
much so as to lift the rider too high above the
horse's back. The shield in front should not
press upon the neck of the horse, but should
barely touch it. The saddle flaps must be well
strapped down, for if they stand out stiffly, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
correct position of the stirrup leg will be interfered
with. A side-saddle should never be too
light in weight, for this will make the back of
the horse sore, especially if he be ridden by a
heavy woman.</p>

<p>The tacks or nails in the under part of the
saddle should be firmly driven in, as they may
otherwise become loose and either injure the
horse, or make him nervous and uneasy. To
avoid trouble of this kind, some people advocate
the use of false pannels, which are fastened to
the saddle-tree by rods or loops, and can be removed
and replaced at will. It is said that by
using them, the same saddle can be made to fit
different horses. The author has no personal
knowledge of this invention, but it has been
strongly recommended to her by several excellent
horsemen. A felt or flannel saddle cloth,
of the same color as the rider's habit, should always
be placed under the saddle, as it helps to
protect the horse's back, as well as to prevent
the saddle from getting soiled.</p>

<p>Every finished side-saddle has three girths.
Two of these are made of felt cloth, or strong
webbing, and are designed to fasten it firmly
upon the horse's back. The third one, made of
leather, is intended to keep the flaps down.
There should always be, on each side, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
straps fastened to the saddle-tree under the
leather flaps; upon two of these the girths are
to be buckled, while the third is an extra one,
to be used as a substitute in case of any accident
to either of the others. Between the outside
leather flaps and the horse's body there should
be an under flap of flannel or cloth, which
should be well padded on the side next the
horse, because, when tightly girthed, the girth-buckles
press directly upon the outside of this
flap, and if its padding be thin, or worn, the
animal will suffer great pain. This is a cause
of restlessness which is seldom noticed, and
many a horse has been thought to be bad tempered
when he was only wild with pain from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the pressure of the girth-buckles against his
side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;Stokes' mode of girthing the saddle.</p>
</div>


<p>The credit of introducing a new method of
tightening girths belongs, so far as we know, to
Mr. Stokes, formerly a riding-teacher in Cincinnati.
This method enables one to girth the
horse tightly, without using so much muscular
effort as is usually required, so that by its
means, a lady can, if she wish, saddle her own
horse. (<a href="#Fig_8" class="inref">Fig. 8.</a>)</p>

<p>The following is a description of Mr. Stokes'
manner of girthing: At the end of each of
the leather girth straps, which hang down between
the flaps on the off-side of the saddle, is
fastened a strong iron buckle without any
tongue, but with a thin steel roller or revolving
cylinder on its lower edge. On the near side
of the saddle the girths are strapped in the
usual manner, but, on the <i>outer</i> end of each
cloth girth there is, in addition to an ordinary
buckle, with a roller on the upper side of it, a
long strap, which is fastened to the under side
of the girth, the buckle being on the upper side.
This strap, when the saddle is girthed, is passed
up through the tongueless buckle, moving easily
over the steel roller, and is then brought down
to the buckle with tongue on the end of the
girth, and there fastened in the usual manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The slipper stirrup, when first introduced, was
a great favorite, for in addition to furnishing an
excellent support, it was believed that it would
release the foot instantly should the rider be
thrown. This latter merit, however, it was
found that it did not possess, as many severe
accidents occurred where this stirrup was used,
especially with the two-pommeled saddle. Instead
of releasing the rider in these cases, as it
was supposed it would, the stirrup tilted up and
held her foot so firmly grasped that she was
dragged some distance before she could be released.
This stirrup, therefore, gradually fell
into disfavor, and is now no longer used by the
best riders.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_9"></a>
<img src="images/fig9.jpg" width="145" height="200" alt="Fig. 9.&mdash;Victoria stirrup." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Victoria stirrup.</p>
</div>

<p>There are, at the present time, three kinds of
stirrups which are favorites among finished riders.
The first is called the "Victoria" because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
it is the one used by the Queen of England.
(<a href="#Fig_9" class="inref">Fig. 9.</a>) In this stirrup the platform on which
the foot rests is broad and comfortable, and
is slightly roughened to prevent the foot from
slipping. A spring-bar attachment (<a href="#Fig_10" class="inref">Fig. 10</a>) is
placed at the top of the stirrup-leather under
the saddle-flap, and at the end of this bar there
is a spring, so that, if the rider be thrown, the
stirrup-leather becomes instantly detached from
the saddle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_10"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Spring-bar for stirrup leather.</p>
</div>

<p>The second variety of stirrup, known as "Lennan's
safety stirrup,"
has all the merit of
the preceding one. If
kept well oiled and
free from mud, it will
release the foot at
once, when an accident
occurs. It may,
if desired, be accompanied
by the spring-bar
attachment, and thus rendered doubly secure.
(<a href="#Fig_11" class="inref">Fig. 11.</a>) Some people, however, dislike
the spring-bar attachment, and prefer to rely
entirely upon the spring of the stirrup to release
the foot.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 11.&mdash;Lennan's safety stirrup.</p>
</div>

<p>The third stirrup, called "Latchford's safety
stirrup," consists of a stirrup within a stirrup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and is so arranged that, when a rider is thrown,
the inner stirrup springs
open and releases the foot.
(<a href="#Fig_12" class="inref">Fig. 12.</a>) Either of these
stirrups can be procured in
London, England, or from
the best saddle-makers in
this country.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>A <b>stirrup-iron</b> should never
be made of cast metal, but invariably
of the best wrought
steel: it should be adapted to
the size of the rider's foot, and should, if possible,
have an instep pad at the top, while the bottom
platform, upon which the foot rests, should be
broad, and roughened on its upper surface.</p>

<p>The <b>stirrup-leather</b> should be of the very
best material, and should have neither fissures
nor cracks in any part of it. It is very important
to examine this leather frequently, and see
that it is neither wearing thin, nor breaking at
its upper part at the bar, nor at the lower part
where it is fastened to the stirrup.</p>

<p>A novel arrangement of the stirrup-leather,
by means of the so-called "balance-strap," has
of late years been used by some riders. The
stirrup is, in this case, fastened to the balance-strap,
which consists of a single strap passing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
through the ring-bar, and then brought down
to within two or three inches of the lower edge
of the saddle-flap; here it is passed through a
slit in the flap, then carried under the horse to
the other side and buckled to another strap,
which is fastened, for this purpose, just below
the off-pommel. By this arrangement the saddle-flaps
on both sides are held down, and the
rider, without dismounting, can change the
length of her stirrup by merely tightening or
loosening this strap. Although highly recommended
by some riders, this balance strap has
one objectionable feature, which is that, as the
measurement of the horse's girth is not constant
during a long ride, it will be necessary to
tighten the strap frequently in order to keep
the stirrup of the proper length. The old way
of fastening is much better, for too much complication
in the saddle and bridle is apt to annoy
and confuse the rider, especially if a novice.
The <b>golden rule</b> in riding on horseback is to
have everything accurate, simple, safe, and
made of the very best material that can be procured.</p>

<p>The <b>bridle</b> should be neatly and plainly
made, with no large rosettes at the sides, nor
highly colored bands across the forehead. The
reins and the head-piece should never be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of rounded straps, but always of flat ones, and
should be of the best and strongest leather, especially
the reins. These should be carefully
examined from time to time, in order to be sure
that there are no imperfections in them. Any
roughness or hardness is an indication of defectiveness,
and may be detected by dexterously
passing the fingers to and fro over the flat surfaces,
which should be smooth, soft, and flexible.
There can hardly be too much care taken about
this matter, for the snapping of a rein always
alarms a horse; and, feeling himself free from
all control, he will be almost certain to run
away, while the rider, if she has no other reins,
will be powerless to protect herself, or to check
him in his purpose.</p>

<p><b>Martingales</b> are rarely used by riders, as
they are troublesome, and can very well be dispensed
with, unless the horse has the disagreeable
trick of raising his head suddenly, from
time to time, when a martingale will become
necessary in order to correct this fault. The
French martingale is the best. This consists of
a single strap, fastened either to the under part
of a nose-band at its centre under the jaw, or
by branches to each side of the snaffle-bit at the
corners of the horse's mouth and then carried
between the fore-legs and fastened to the girth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
When the horse raises his head too high this
strap pulls upon the nose-band, compresses
his nostrils, interferes with his breathing, and
causes him to lower his head promptly. The
horse should not be too much confined by the
martingale, for the object is simply to prevent
him from lifting his head too high, and all other
ordinary movements should be left free.</p>

<p>Among the many <b>bits</b> which have been used,
that known as the "Pelham"
has been highly
praised, although, at the
present time, it is almost,
if not entirely, out of use.
It might, however, from
the severity of its curb
prove of service in controlling
a hard-mouthed
horse, although such a one should never be
ridden by a lady. The Chifney bit is another
very severe one, and is very useful in managing
a horse that pulls hard. But if the animal have
a tender mouth, this bit should be used with
great caution, and not at all by an inexperienced
rider. (<a href="#Fig_13" class="inref">Fig. 13.</a>)</p>

<p>The bit known as the "snaffle," when made
plain and not twisted, is the mildest of all bits,
and some horses will move readily only when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
this is used, the curb instantly rousing their
temper. Others, again, do best with a combination
of the curb and the snaffle, and although
the former may seldom require to be used, its
mere presence in the mouth of the horse will
prove a sufficient check to prevent him from
running away. Most horses, however, especially
those ridden by ladies, require a light use of the
curb to bring them to their best gait.</p>

</div>

<p>The bit used and recommended by many, but
not by the author, is a
curb so arranged as to
form a combination bit in
one piece. It consists of
a curb (<a href="#Fig_14" class="inref">Fig. 14</a>), to each
side of which, at the angles
of the horse's mouth,
a ring is attached, and to
each of these rings is fastened
a rein. This gives a
second pair of reins and
converts the curb into a kind of snaffle. In
this way it answers the purpose of both curb
and snaffle without crowding the horse's mouth
with two separate bits.</p>

<p>If two bits should be used&mdash;the curb and
bridoon&mdash;instead of the above combination bit,
the bridoon should be placed in the horse's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
mouth in such a way as not to interfere with
the action of the curb; it must, therefore, be
neither too thick nor too long, and so fitted into
the angles of the mouth as to neither wrinkle
nor draw back the lips.</p>

<p>The bit should always be made of the best
steel, be well rounded, and perfectly smooth.
Above all it should be accurately fitted to the
horse's mouth: if it be too narrow it will compress
his lips against the bars of his mouth, and
the pain thereby occasioned will render him
very restive. The mouth-piece should be just
long enough to have the cheeks of the bit fit
closely to the outer surface of the lips without
compressing them, and
must not be so long as to
become displaced obliquely
when a rein is pulled.</p>

</div>

<p>According to Major
Dwyer, who is a high
authority on the subject
of bits,&mdash;and whose little
work should be carefully
studied by all bit-makers,&mdash;it
seems to be the general
rule to have the lower
bar or cheek of the curb-bit twice as long as the
upper one; but, as there is no standard measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
for the upper one the other is frequently
made too long. Major Dwyer states that the
mouth-piece, for any horse of ordinary size,
should be one and three fourths inches for the
upper bar, and three and a half inches for the
lower one. This makes five and one fourth
inches for the entire length of the two bars,
from the point at which the curb-hook acts
above to that where the lower ring acts below.
(<a href="#Fig_15" class="inref">Fig. 15.</a>) For ordinary ponies the upper bar
may be one and a half inches, and the lower
one three, making a total length of four and a
half inches.</p>

<p>Every lady rider should know that the longer
the lower bar, the thinner the mouth-piece, and
the higher the "port," the more severe and
painful will be the action of the bit upon the
horse's mouth. For a horse of ordinary size,
the width of the port should be one and one
third inches; for a pony, one inch. The height
will vary according to the degree of severity
required.</p>

<p>The curb-chain, for a horse that has a chin-groove
of medium size, should be about four
fifths of an inch wide, as a chain that is rather
broad and flat is less painful for the horse than
a thin, sharp one. If the chin-groove be very
narrow, a curb-chain of less width will have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
be used, and should be covered with cloth; or,
instead of a chain, a narrow strap of leather
may be used, which should be kept soft and
pliable. The proper length for the curb-chain,
not including the curb-hooks, is about one fourth
more than the width of the animal's mouth.
The hooks should be exactly alike, and about
an inch and a quarter long.</p>

<p>Some horses are very expert in the trick of
catching the cheek of the bit between their
teeth. To remedy this vice a lip-strap may be
used; but it will be found much better to have
each cheek or bar bent into the form of the letter
<span class="letter">S</span>, remembering, however, that the measurement
of the length, referred to above, must in
the case of curved bars be made in a straight
line. Sometimes the upper bar of the curb-bit
will, on account of the peculiar form of the
horse's head, press against and gall his cheeks.
When this is noticed, most people change the
bit, and get one with a longer mouth-piece;
but where the mouth-piece is of the same
length as the width of the mouth, the proper
remedy for this difficulty will be to have the
upper bar bent out enough to free the cheeks
from its pressure.</p>

<p>The curb-bit once made and properly adjusted
to the head-stall, the next step will be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<b>fit it accurately</b> to the horse's mouth. Every
rider should thoroughly understand not only
how to do this, but also how to place the saddle
correctly upon the horse. Upon these points
nearly all grooms require instruction, and very
few gentlemen, even, know how to arrange a
side-saddle so as to have it comfortable for both
horse and rider. Moreover, should the lady be
riding alone, as frequently happens in the country,
and meet with any accident to saddle or
bridle, or need to have either adjusted, she
would, without knowledge on these subjects, be
completely helpless, whereas with it she could
promptly remedy the difficulty.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_16"></a>
<img src="images/fig16-small.jpg" width="318" height="350" alt="Fig. 16.&mdash;The Bit adjusted." />

<p class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;The Bit adjusted.<br />

<p class="bigpic"><a href="images/fig16-large.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>In order to adjust the bit permanently to the
head-stall, so that afterwards the horse can always
be properly bridled, one must proceed as
follows: having first fitted the head-stall to the
horse's head by means of the upper buckles,
the bit must then be adjusted, by means of the
lower ones, in such a manner that the canons
of the mouth-piece will rest on the bars of the
horse's mouth, exactly opposite the chin-groove.
(<a href="#Fig_16" class="inref">Fig. 16.</a>) Should the tusks of the horse be irregularly
placed, the mouth-piece must be adjusted
a little higher than the projecting tusks, so as
to just avoid touching them. The curb-chain
may now be hooked into the ring of the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
bar on the off-side, leaving one link loose, after
which the other hook must be fastened to the
ring of the bar on the near-side, leaving two
links loose. Care should be taken to have the
curb-chain rest with its flat surface against the
chin-groove in such a way that it will have no
tendency to rise up when the reins are pulled
upon. The curb-chain should never be tight;
there must always be room enough between it
and the chin to insert the first and second fingers
of the right hand flatwise; and, while the
fingers are thus placed, if the reins are drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
up, it will be easy to ascertain whether the chain
pinches. If, when the reins are tightened, the
bit stands stiff and immovable, it will show that
the chain is too short and needs to be lengthened
a link or two. If the horse gently yields
his head to the tightening of the reins, without
suddenly drawing back, or thrusting out his
nose as the tension is increased, it will prove
that the bit is correctly placed. But if the
lower bars of the bit can be drawn back quite
a distance before the horse will yield to the pull
of the reins, then the chain is too long, and
should be shortened. "Lightness, accuracy,
easy motion, a total absence of stiffness, constraint,
or painful action, are the characteristics
of good bitting; and if these be attained,
ready obedience to the rider's hand will be the
result."&mdash;<i>F. Dwyer.</i></p>

<p>When the bit has once been correctly adjusted
to the head-stall and to the horse's
mouth, there will be little difficulty in bridling
him upon any subsequent occasion. Thus:
standing at the left of the horse's head, the
head-stall, held by its upper part in the right
hand, should be lifted up in front of the horse's
head, while the left hand, holding the bit by its
mouth-piece, should put this between the animal's
lips, press it against his teeth, and into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
mouth, which he will generally open a little in
order to admit it. As soon as this has been accomplished,
the upper part of the head-stall
must be promptly raised so as to bring its upper
strap or band across the forehead, while at the
same time the horse's ears are passed between
the forehead band and the strap which forms
the upper part of the head-stall.</p>

<p>During these man&oelig;uvres, the curb-chain
must be passed under the chin, so as to rest
against the chin-groove, and care be taken to
keep the fingers of the left hand out of the
horse's mouth while the mouth-piece is being
put in. The bit and head-stall having been
properly arranged, the whole should be secured
by buckling the throat-strap loosely on the left
side. If this strap be buckled tightly, the horse
will be unable to bend his neck properly. The
mouth-piece of the bit should be washed, dried,
and then rubbed with fresh olive or cotton-seed
oil, each time after use, to preserve it from rust.</p>

<p>Neither a rusted bit nor a very cold one
should ever be put into a horse's mouth. In
frosty winter weather the bit should always be
warmed. Many a valuable horse has had his
mouth seriously injured by having an icy cold
mouth-piece put into it, to say nothing of the
pain and suffering it must invariably occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to produce a neat and pleasing appearance,
there should be no unsightly ends or
straps left dangling from the loops of the head-stall.
They should be so snugly fitted into
their places that they cannot work out of their
loops.</p>

<p>The forehead band should never be too tight
for the horse's comfort, and the small rosettes
that lie over his temples should be well oiled
underneath and kept soft.</p>

<p>A side-saddle may be made accurately according
to all recognized rules, and yet lose nearly
all its good effects by being improperly put
on; the rider will be made uncomfortable, the
horse's back will be injured, and the saddle will
eventually have its padding so compressed in
the wrong direction that it will be impossible to
put it on in the right way.</p>

<p>Every lady rider should know as well how to
have her saddle properly adjusted as how to sit
her horse or manage the reins. On a well-formed
horse, with rather high withers and
sloping shoulders, the centre of the saddle
should be placed over the middle of the back,
and be so arranged that the front part of the
saddle-tree shall be a very short distance back
of the horse's shoulder-blade, for if allowed to
rest upon the shoulder-blade it will interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
very much with the action of the shoulder muscles.
It is a common fault of grooms to place
the saddle a little sideways, and too far forward
on the withers. The well-taught rider can,
however, easily decide whether the saddle is in
the right position: standing on the off-side of
the horse, she must pass her right hand under
the arch of the saddle-tree, which should be directly
over the withers, and see whether it sits
perfectly even, bearing no more to one side than
to the other; then stepping behind the horse,
but at a safe distance from his heels, she can
see whether the long central furrow of the
under surface of the saddle-seat from front to
rear (chamber) is in a direct line with the animal's
backbone, and forms an open space over
it. If these conditions are fulfilled, the saddle
is properly adjusted. If the horse have rather
straight shoulders, together with a plump, round
body, the saddle will require to be placed rather
farther forward, but with the chamber still in a
line with the backbone. On some horses of
this shape, the saddle, to be held securely, will
need to be set so far forward that the girths
will have to pass close to the fore-legs. A
horse of this description is not suitable for the
side-saddle, but as ladies in the country and in
the far West are sometimes obliged to ride such,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
it is very important for their safety to know
how these ill-formed animals should be saddled,
because should the saddle be put too far back on
such horses, it will be sure to turn.</p>

<p>It not infrequently happens that after the
saddle has been placed in the correct position,
it becomes slightly displaced while being fastened.
To avoid this, it should always be
girthed on the off-side, and great care be taken,
when fastening the girths, especially the first
one, that the saddle be not jerked over to the
left; and that in pulling upon the short strap
on the off-side, to which the girth is to be
buckled, the saddle be not forced to the right.</p>

<p>When girthing the saddle, the lady may
place her left hand on the middle of the seat
and hold it steady while she arranges the first
girth, and with her right hand draws it as
tightly as she can, without using violent exertion,
or making any sudden jerk; she will then
be able, with both hands, to tighten the girth
as much as is necessary, doing this with an even,
regular pull, so that the saddle will not be
moved out of place. Before fastening the other
girths, she should step behind the horse and assure
herself that the chamber is in a line with
the horse's backbone, as before described. If
it is not, she must loosen the girth, and, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
straightening the saddle, proceed as before.
The girth to be first fastened is the one nearest
the horse's fore-legs; the second girth is the one
back of the first, and should be placed evenly
over the first one and fastened equally tight;
the third is the leather girth which is intended
to keep down the saddle-flaps; this must be
placed evenly over the other two, but it is not
essential to have it drawn so tight as they, but
just enough so to hold the flaps. Most horses
have a trick, when they are being girthed, of
expanding their sides and abdomen, for the purpose
of securing a loose girthing; and girths
that seem almost too tight when they are first
buckled are often found to be too loose after
the rider has mounted. Too tight a girth is injurious
to the horse, but too loose a one may
cause the saddle to turn. A round, plump horse
with low withers will need tighter girthing than
a better shaped one. The lady rider should
study the shape of her horse, and use her own
judgment as to how tight the girths should be
drawn, making due allowance for the trick alluded
to above. If there is any second person
present while the saddle is being arranged, matters
may be facilitated if this person will hold
the saddle firmly by the off-pommel while the
girthing is being done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The author has been thus particular in describing
the bit and saddle with their proper
arrangement, as well as the girthing of the
horse, because so few lady riders bestow any attention
upon these very important matters; and
yet, if one desires to ride safely and well, a
knowledge of them is positively necessary.
Grooms cannot always be depended upon, and,
indeed, seldom know much about the side-saddle;
there is an adage which is applicable to
many of them: "Too much must not be expected
from the head of him who labors only
with his hands." In the instructions given by
gentlemen writers, useful as they may be in
many respects, there is usually a good deal of
practical information omitted which a lady rider
ought to know, but the necessity of which it is
perhaps impossible for a gentleman fully to appreciate
or understand; this knowledge the
lady will have to gain either from her own experience
or from one of her own sex who has
studied the subject carefully.</p>

<p>In preparing for horseback riding, nothing
should be omitted that can give greater security
to the rider, or protect her more completely
from accident of any sort. Every article should
be of the very best material, so that a breakage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
or casualty of any kind may be only a remote
possibility. The knowledge that everything is
right, and firmly and properly placed, creates a
confidence which adds greatly to the pleasure
of the ride.</p>

<p>A novice in riding always experiences in a
greater or less degree a sense of trepidation and
embarrassment when, for the first time, a horse
duly caparisoned for a lady rider is put before
her, and she is expected to seat herself in the
saddle. If she be a timid person, the apparent
difficulty of this feat occasions a dismay which
the good-natured champing of the bit and impatient
head shakings of the horse do not tend
to diminish. If, however, she be accustomed to
horses as pets, and understand their ways, she
will be much less apprehensive about mounting
than the lady who has only observed them at a
distance and is entirely ignorant of their nature.
The author has known ladies, after their horses
had been brought to the door, to send them
back to the stable because courage failed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
when it became necessary to trust themselves
on the back of an animal of which they knew
nothing. To overcome this timidity the lady
must become better acquainted with her horse,
and, to do so, should visit him occasionally in
his stable, feed him with choice morsels, and
lead him about the yard from time to time. By
these means a mutual friendship and confidence
will be created, and the lady will gradually gain
enough courage to place herself in the saddle.</p>

<p>The first attempt at mounting should be made
from a <b>high horse-block</b> with some one to hold
the head of the horse and keep him still. Turning
her right side somewhat toward the horse's
left, and slightly raising the skirt of her riding
habit, the lady should spring from her left foot
towards the saddle, at the same time raising her
right leg so that it will pass directly over the
second and third pommels. This accomplished,
the left foot may be placed in the stirrup.</p>

<p>Another method of mounting from a rather
high horse-block, when the pommels are high, is
for the lady to face the horse's left side, and,
seizing the off-pommel with the right hand and
the second one with the left, to spring towards
the saddle from her left foot, and seat herself
sidewise. She can then turn her body so as to
face the horse's head, place her right leg over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the second pommel,&mdash;adjusting her skirt at the
same time,&mdash;and slip her left foot into the stirrup
and her left knee under the third pommel.</p>

<p>Should the <b>horse-block be low</b> and the lady
short, she will be obliged to mount somewhat
after a man's fashion, thus: Placing her left
foot in the stirrup, and grasping the second
pommel with her left hand, she should spring
from her right foot, and, as she rises, grasp the
off-pommel with her right hand; by means of
this spring, aided by the pommels and stirrup,
she can seat herself sideways in the saddle, turning
her body for this purpose just before gaining
the seat. In the absence of a horse-block,
from which to mount, the assistance of a chair
or stool should never be resorted to unless there
is some one to hold it firm and steady.</p>

<p>When the rider is obliged to <b>mount</b> without
assistance and <b>from the ground</b>, if the balance-strap,
before referred to, be used with her stirrup,
she can let this strap down far enough to
enable her to put her foot in the stirrup easily,
and to use it as a sort of stepping-stone by
means of which, and a spring from her right
foot, she can reach the saddle sideways. In doing
this she must grasp the second pommel
firmly with her left hand, in which she also
should hold her whip and the reins; on rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
she must aid herself by grasping with the right
hand the off-pommel as soon as she can reach it.
When she is seated, the stirrup can be adjusted
from the off-side by means of the balance-strap.</p>

<p>If, however, she uses the old-fashioned stirrup-leather,
and there is no assistance of any
kind at hand, neither horse-block, chair, nor
stool, not even a fence or steep bank from which
to mount,&mdash;a situation in which a rider might
possibly be placed,&mdash;then reaching the saddle
becomes a very puzzling affair, unless the lady
be so active that she can spring from the ground
to her saddle. To try the plan of lengthening
the stirrup-leather will be dangerous, because,
in order to readjust it after mounting, she will
have to sit on the back part of the saddle, bend
over the horse's left side, and pull up the stirrup-leather
in order to shorten and buckle it; while
in this position, if the horse should start, she
would probably be thrown instantly. Her
safest course would be to lead the horse until a
place is found where she can mount. If she
should have to use a fence for this purpose let
her be sure that the posts are firmly fixed in
the ground, and that the boards are neither
loose nor easily broken.</p>

<p>When mounting, the whip and reins should
be held in the left hand, the former with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
point down, so that it may not hit the horse,
and the latter grasped just tightly enough to
feel the horse's mouth without pulling on it.
In order to arrange the folds of the riding skirt
after mounting, the reins and whip must be
transferred to the right hand; then, resting
this hand upon the off-pommel, the rider should
raise herself free from the saddle by straightening
her left knee and standing on the stirrup,
also aiding herself by means of the right hand
on the pommel. While thus standing she can
quickly arrange the skirt with her left hand.</p>

<p>None of the methods of mounting just described&mdash;with
the exception of the first one&mdash;are
at all graceful, and they should never be
used except in case of absolute necessity. The
most graceful way for a lady to reach the saddle,
and the one that is taught in the best riding
schools, is by the <b>assistance of a gentleman</b>.
The rider's education will not be complete until
she has learned this method of mounting, which,
when accomplished easily and gracefully, is delightful
to witness. It should be learned after
the preliminary lessons at the horse-block have
been taken. In using this simple manner of
reaching the saddle, the rider will have three
distinct points of support, namely, the shoulder
of the gentleman who assists her, the united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
palms of his hands, and her own hold upon the
pommel.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;Lady ready to mount her horse.</p>
</div>

<p>The stirrup having been placed across the
shield of the saddle in front of the pommels,
the lady, holding the reins and the whip with
its point down in her right hand,&mdash;which
must rest upon the second pommel,&mdash;should
stand with her right side toward the horse's
left, about four or five inches from it, her left
shoulder being slightly turned back. Then,
taking a firm hold upon the second pommel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
with her right hand, she should with the left
lift her riding skirt enough to enable her to
place her left foot fairly and squarely into the
gentleman's palms, which should be clasped
firmly together. This done, she should drop
the skirt, place her left hand upon his right
shoulder, bend her knee, or give the word
"ready," as a signal, and at once spring from
her right foot up and a little towards the horse.
The gentleman, at the same moment, must raise
his hands, and move them toward the horse.
The lady must, when rising, press or bear lightly
upon his shoulder, and also keep a firm hold
upon the second pommel, which she must not
relinquish until she is seated. If correctly performed,
this man&oelig;uvre will place the rider in
the saddle sideways. The gentleman should
then remove the stirrup from the front of the
saddle, while the lady transfers the reins to her
left hand, passes her right knee over the second
pommel and her left under the third. She will
then be ready to have her foot placed in the
stirrup. (<a href="#Fig_17" class="inref">Fig. 17.</a>)</p>

<p>It will, however, be found very difficult to
mount in this manner, gracefully, unless the
gentleman who assists thoroughly understands
his duties; should he be awkward about helping
her, the lady will find it much better to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
depend upon the horse-block. If, for instance,
he should raise his hands too high, or with too
much energy, when she makes her spring, he
may push her too far over, or even&mdash;if she
should loosen her grasp of the second pommel,&mdash;cause
her to fall from the off-side of the
horse. This is a dangerous accident, and almost
certain to occasion severe injuries. On
the other hand, if he does not use energy
enough, or neglects to carry his hands toward
the body of the horse as the lady rises, she may
not reach the saddle at all, and will he apt to
fall to the ground on the left side of the horse,
especially if she relinquishes her hold on the
second pommel. The gentleman must also be
careful not to let his foot rest on the lady's skirt,
as this will pull her back, and perhaps tear the
dress, as she makes her spring.</p>

<p>In assisting a lady to mount, the <b>gentleman</b>
should first arrange the snaffle-reins evenly and
of the proper length, and place them in her
right hand, leaving the curb-reins to lie loosely
on the neck of the horse. Then, after putting
the stirrup out of the way, as described above,
he should take a position facing her, with his
left shoulder toward the left shoulder of the
horse. Clasping his hands together with the
palms turned up, he should stoop sufficiently to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
enable her to put her left foot upon them, and,
in raising them as she springs, he must gradually
assume the erect posture. When the lady
is seated, he should return the stirrup to its
proper position and place her foot in it, after
first, with his left hand, adjusting her skirt so
that it will fall evenly; he should then place
the curb-reins in her left hand, with the others.
No gentleman is a finished equestrian, nor a desirable
companion for a lady on horseback, who
does not know how to assist her dexterously
and gracefully to mount and dismount.</p>

<p>A lady who is not very nimble in her movements,
or who is very heavy, should be extremely
careful in mounting not to accept assistance
from a gentleman who is not strong
enough to support her weight easily and firmly.
It will be much better for her to use a horse-block
or something of the kind. But if she does
accept the aid of a gentleman, the following
changes in the methods described above have
been recommended: instead of facing her, he
should stand close to her side, with his face
turned in the same direction as hers: she should
then place her left foot in his united hands, and
in order to do so must pass her left leg between
his right arm and his body. He will thus be
enabled to support and lift her with greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ease, and, as she rises, her left leg will readily
escape from under his right arm, and she will
be able to seat herself sideways in the saddle, as
by the former method. During this man&oelig;uvre
she must sustain herself by the second pommel,
as in the preceding instance.</p>

<p>If a horse is restless and uneasy when being
mounted, he should be held by a third person,
who must stand in front of his head and take
a firm hold of the curb-bit on each side, but
without touching the reins, which should always
be held and managed by the rider only. It is
<i>always</i> a better plan, when mounting, to have
the horse held, although a well-trained horse
will stand quietly without such control.</p>

<p>Mounting is a part of the rider's education
which should be carefully studied and practiced,
for when properly and gracefully accomplished
it is the very poetry of motion, and will enable
her to display more pliancy and lightness than
she can even in the ball-room. There is another
branch of the rider's education which
also requires careful study, as it is rarely accomplished
satisfactorily, and is apt to occasion as
much embarrassment and dismay to a beginner
as mounting. This is <b>dismounting</b>. To alight
from a horse easily and well, without disarranging
the dress, and without being awkwardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
precipitated into the arms of the gentleman
who assists, is by no means an easy task, and
very few lady riders accomplish it with skill and
address.</p>

<p>When assisting his companion from the saddle,
the gentleman should stand about a foot
from her with his face toward the horse, while
she, after taking her foot from the stirrup and
disengaging her right leg from the pommel,
must turn her body so as to face him. After
putting the stirrup over the shield of the saddle,
as in mounting, he should then extend his hands
so as to support her by the elbows, while she
rests a hand upon each of his shoulders. Then,
by giving a gentle spring, she will glide lightly
to the ground, he meanwhile supporting her
with his hands, and, as she descends, bending
his body, and moving his right side slightly
backward. She can also assist him to lessen
the shock as she touches the ground by bending
her knees a little, as if courtesying.</p>

<p>Another way of assisting the lady, especially
if she be rather stout and not very active, is
for the gentleman to clasp her waist with both
hands, instead of holding her by the elbows.
He should, in this case, stand as far from her as
he can while still supporting her, and, as she
descends, should make a step backward with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
right foot, and turn a little away from the horse,
which should be held by a third person, in the
manner described before, in mounting.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_18"></a>
<img src="images/fig18.jpg" width="500" height="434" alt="Fig. 18.&mdash;Lady ready to dismount." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 18.&mdash;Lady ready to dismount.</p>
</div>


<p>Another, and more graceful way of dismounting
is the following: The gentleman, standing
about a foot from his companion and directly
facing her, takes in his left hand her bridle,&mdash;as
near as he can to the horse's mouth, that he
may hold him as firmly and securely as possible,&mdash;the
lady now drops the reins on the horse's
neck, disengages her foot from the stirrup, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
her leg from the second pommel, and then seats
herself sideways in the saddle, so as to face her
assistant, who now places the stirrup on the
front of the saddle with his right hand; he then
offers his right shoulder to the lady for her support.
She, after gathering up in her left hand
a few folds of her riding skirt, in order to have
her feet free when she alights, places upon his
shoulder the hand which holds the skirt, and
with the other, in which she holds her whip
point downward, grasps the second pommel and
springs lightly from the saddle, the gentleman
bending over a little as she descends. On reaching
the ground, she should, as before described,
bend her knees slightly to lessen the shock of
the descent. (<a href="#Fig_18" class="inref">Fig. 18.</a>)</p>

<p>In all these modes of dismounting, the lady,
before attempting to alight, should be sure that
her skirt is quite free from the pommels, especially
from the second one, and that it is so adjusted
that it will not be trodden upon when she
reaches the ground, but will fall evenly about
her, without being in any way disarranged.</p>

<p>It happens not infrequently that a lady is
obliged to dismount without <b>any one to assist
her</b>, and in this case she should ride up to a
horse-block so as to bring the left side of her
horse close to it, let the curb reins fall upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
neck, retaining, however, the whip and snaffle-reins
in her left hand, and then, removing her
foot from the stirrup and her right leg from
the pommel, she should seat herself a little sideways
upon the saddle. Now, with a slight turn
of her shoulders to the right, she should place
her left hand&mdash;still holding the whip and
reins&mdash;upon the second pommel, and her right
hand upon the off one, and thus alight sideways
with her face toward the horse's head. In effecting
this man&oelig;uvre, she must be careful to
retain her hold upon the snaffle-reins and also
upon the second pommel until she is safe upon
the horse-block; she must also remember the
caution given before, in regard to having her
skirts free from the pommels.</p>

<p>To <b>dismount upon the ground</b>, or upon a
very low horse-block, <b>without</b> assistance, is a
difficult feat to execute gracefully, but some
young ladies in the country, who are active and
light, accomplish it so easily and quickly that
they do not appear awkward. The manner in
which this is to be done is nearly the same as
that just explained, the only difference being,
that the gliding down must be effected quickly
and lightly, and the rider, as she passes down,
must release her hold upon the off-pommel, but
retain that upon the second, also taking care to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
have the reins quite loose. This mode of alighting
is, however, entirely out of place except in
the country, where assistance cannot always be
had readily, or in cases where the lady is obliged
to dismount very quickly.</p>

<p>If the lady rider, after carefully studying
these different methods of mounting and dismounting
with assistance, will select the one
she thinks suits her best, and then practice it a
few times with her gentleman escort, she will
soon find herself able to perform with ease these
apparently difficult feats, and will have no need
of resorting to a horse-block, nor to some secluded
spot, where she can mount or dismount
unobserved. A lady once told the author that
the pleasure of her daily ride was at one time
almost spoiled by the knowledge that she must
mount and dismount in front of a hotel, the
piazza of which was always crowded with observers,
for, not having been properly taught to
execute these man&oelig;uvres, she was rather awkward
at them. She, however, placed herself
under correct tuition, and soon overcame the
difficulty. She can now execute these movements
with such grace and elegance as to fascinate
gentlemen, and excite the envy of rival
belles who are still obliged to seek the aid of a
horse-block.</p>

<h3>THE SEAT ON HORSEBACK.</h3>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bounded the fiery steed in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rider sat erect and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then like a bolt from steel cross-bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth launched, along the plain they go."<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="citation"><i>Lady of the Lake.</i></p>
</div></div>


<p>A correct seat is very seldom attained by
the self-taught lady rider, for her attitude on
the horse is so artificial that she cannot, like the
gentleman rider, whose seat is more easy and
natural, fall directly into the proper position.
Competent instruction alone can enable her to
gain the safe and easy posture which will give
the least possible fatigue to herself and to her
horse. It is true that a natural rider, or she
who professes to ride instinctively, may to-day
accidentally assume the proper position in the
saddle, but, as she has no rule by which to guide
herself, and is entirely unacquainted with the
"whys and wherefores" of a correct seat, she
will to-morrow assume the incorrect position, so
natural to a self-taught rider, and the pleasant
ride of to-day will be followed by a rough and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
unpleasant one to-morrow. On the one occasion,
the poor horse will receive much praise for
his easy motion, and on the next be highly censured
for the roughness of his gait, for the lady
will not suspect that the real difficulty lies in
her own ignorance of a correct attitude, and in
her bad management of the poor beast.</p>

<p>Upon the position of the upper part of the
body depends not only grace and pliancy, and
that harmony between horse and rider which is
so highly desirable and, indeed, necessary, but
also the ability to manage the reins properly;
for, if the rider be not well balanced, her hands
will be unsteady, and seldom in the right position
for controlling the animal.</p>

<p>But the proper position of the body above
the saddle depends upon the correct arrangement
of the lower limbs; if they are not in the
right position, the rider will lean too far forward,
or too far back, or too much to one side
or the other. She will also lose all firmness of
seat, and, consequently, all safety in riding.
This faulty position of the lower limbs has been,
and still is, the occasion of much incorrect riding,
but is a point which is seldom regarded by
the gentleman teacher. He, indeed, cannot
possibly know how the legs are arranged, when
they are covered by the riding skirt, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
seldom gives the subject any thought; yet
he wonders, after carefully watching and correcting
the position of the body, why his pupil
does not retain the erect position as directed.
A lady teacher of experience is, therefore, much
to be preferred to a gentleman, unless the lady
pupil is willing to wear, while taking her lessons,
trousers similar to those worn during calisthenic
exercises.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a lady, even after
being carefully instructed how to sit in the saddle,
and when she seems to understand what is
necessary, will yet present a very erect but stiff
appearance, as if she were made of cast-iron, or
some other unyielding material. This may be
due to nervousness, fear, tight-lacing, or affectation.
Practice in riding, loose corsets, and
less affectation, will soon remedy this stiffness.</p>

<p>Another faulty position is one which may be
termed "the dead weight seat," which is only
possible when riding on an English saddle. It
consists in sitting or bearing chiefly upon the
left side of the saddle, the right leg firmly
grasping the second pommel, and the left leg
squeezed tightly between the stirrup and the
third pommel, as if held in a vise. In this position
the rider will be fastened to her horse as
closely as if she were a package of merchandise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
strapped upon the back of a pack-horse. She
will appear indolent and inanimate, besides riding
heavily, and thus distressing and discouraging
her horse; for a well-trained horse will
always prefer to keep in unison with the movements
of his rider, but will find it impossible to
do so, when she adopts this constrained, unyielding
seat. The rider will also be made miserable,
for the constant effort to keep steady by
a continuous pressure of the left knee against
the third pommel will not only prove wearisome,
but will be apt to bruise her knee, as well
as strain the muscles of the upper part of the
leg, and the next day she will feel very stiff and
lame. In addition to which it will be impossible
for her to rise in the English trot, or to move
her body to the right in the gallop or canter
when the horse leads with his left leg. Moreover,
should the lady who thus hangs upon the
pommel be rather heavy, her horse's back will
be sure to receive more or less injury, no matter
how well the saddle may be made and padded.</p>

<p>Although the second pommel should be firmly
grasped by the right knee, and the left knee be
strongly pressed up against the third one, when
the horse is unruly or trying to unseat his rider,
these supports should not be habitually employed,
but kept for critical situations, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
then the body must be kept erect, yet flexible.
A rider who depends entirely upon the pommels
to enable her to keep her seat is a bad rider,
who will soon acquire all kinds of awkward and
ridiculous positions, and expose herself to much
severe criticism.</p>

<p>The opposite of the "dead-weight seat" is
what may be termed the "wabbling seat."
This is seen where the old-fashioned saddle is
used; the rider, instead of sitting firm and
erect, bounds up and down like a rubber ball
tossed by an unseen hand. This can be remedied
by the substitution of the English saddle,
whose third pommel, when used judiciously and
aided by a proper balance of the body, will give
the required firmness of seat, which should be
neither too rigid nor too yielding.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/fig19.jpg" width="194" height="450" alt="Fig. 19.&mdash;Correct Seat for a Lady.
Back View." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 19.&mdash;Correct Seat for a Lady.<br />
Back View.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The correct seat</b>, universally adopted by finished
riders, is the following: The lady should
seat herself exactly on the centre of the saddle,
with her body erect, and her backbone in a direct
line with that of the horse, at a right angle
with it. A spectator can readily tell whether
the rider is in the centre of the saddle by observing
whether the space between the buttons
on the hind flaps of her riding-jacket corresponds
with the backbone of the horse, and also
with the chamber of the saddle. (<a href="#Fig_19" class="inref">Fig. 19.</a>) Or
the lady can herself decide the question by
placing her fingers between these two buttons,
and then carrying the former in a straight line
directly down to the chamber of the saddle; if
these coincide, and if she has placed herself far
enough back on the saddle to be able to grasp
the second pommel comfortably with her right
knee, while the left one is just spanned by the
third pommel, then she is in a position to ride
with ease to herself and horse, for she now sits
upon that part of the animal which is the centre
of motion in his forward movement, and
in this position can keep in unison with the cadence
of his various gaits. Again, her weight
being exactly upon the centre of motion, she
can with difficulty be unseated or shaken off
by the most violent efforts of the horse, for,
whether he springs suddenly forward, or sideways,
or whirls around, the rider is in a position
at once to anticipate his movement, to keep a
firm seat, and quickly to gain her balance.</p>

<p>When the horse advances straight forward,
the rider&mdash;sitting with head erect and her
body so placed that its entire front is directed
toward the horse's head, or, in other words, that
<i>a straight line drawn from one hip to the other
would form a right angle with one drawn along
the centre of the horse's head and neck</i>&mdash;must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
throw her shoulders somewhat back, so as to expand
her chest, taking care, however, to keep the
shoulders in line, and not to elevate one more
than the other. There should also be, at the
back of the waist, a slight inward bend which
will throw the front of the waist a little forward.
The arms, from the shoulders to the
elbows, must hang perpendicularly, and the
elbows be held loosely but steadily and in an
easy manner, near the rider's sides, and not be
allowed to flap up and down with every movement.
The hands must be held low and about
three or four inches from the body. The bearing
of the head, the backward throw of the
shoulders, and the curve at the waist, are exactly
like those assumed by a finished waltzer,
and if the reader is herself a dancer, or will
notice the carriage of a good dancer gliding
around the ball-room, she can readily understand
the attitude required for a correct seat in
the saddle.</p>

<p>The right knee should grasp the second pommel
firmly, but not hang upon it in order to
help the rider keep her seat and balance. The
right leg, from the hip to the knee, must be
kept as steady as possible, because from a
woman's position in the saddle, the movements
of her horse tend to throw her toward his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
side, and she must guard against this by bearing
slightly toward his right. From the knee
to the foot, the right leg must be in contact
with the fore-flap of the saddle, the heel being
inclined backward a little.</p>

<p>The left knee should be placed just below the
third pommel, so that this will span it lightly,
close enough to assist in preserving a firm seat,
yet not so close as to interfere with the action
of the leg in the English trot. From the knee
to the foot this left leg must be held in a
straight line perpendicular to the ground, and
the knee be lightly pressed against the side-flap
of the saddle. The ball of the foot must be
placed evenly in the stirrup, the heel being a
little lower than the toes, which should be
pointed toward the shoulder of the horse. (<a href="#Fig_20" class="inref">Fig.
20.</a>)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_20"></a>

1, third pommel; 2, second pommel.</p>
<p class="bigpic"><a href="images/fig20-large.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>If the rider will seat herself in the saddle in
the manner just described, she will find that she
has a very firm seat, from which she cannot
easily be displaced; but in order to appear
graceful she must be flexible, and adapt herself
readily to the motions of her horse. The shoulders,
for example, although thrown back, must
not be rigid, and the body, while erect, must be
supple; the head be upright and free, and, in
the leap, or when circling in the gallop, the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
must be pliant, yielding and bending with the
movements of the horse, but always resuming
afterward the easy erect position. But it must
be borne in mind that the above directions in
regard to carriage apply to the times when the
horse is moving, and need not be observed in
full rigor at other times. When, for instance,
the horse is standing, the rider may assume a
more easy posture, collecting herself and steed
simultaneously when she wishes him to move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The novice in riding should never be allowed
to touch rein or whip until she has acquired a
good seat, and a correct balance. During her
first lessons, some one should ride by her side
and lead her horse, while she, folding her hands
in front of her waist, should give all her attention
to gaining a correct seat; or, she may
practice circling to the right by means of the
lunge line, which will prove excellent training,
and will teach her to bear toward the off or
right side, for it has already been stated that
the motion in the side-saddle has a tendency to
impel the rider toward the left, and this tendency
must always be guarded against by bearing
the body a little to the right. Circling to
the right, when riding in the track of the riding-school,
is also a useful exercise for this purpose,
but as riding-schools are not always to be had
conveniently, the lunge line will be found very
useful, many riders, indeed, considering it even
better than riding in the ring, as it keeps the
horse well up to his gait.</p>

<p>During a few of the first lessons, that the
rider may not fall from the saddle, the stirrup-leather
may be somewhat shortened, but as soon
as an idea of the proper balance has been acquired
and the reins and whip are placed in her
hands, the stirrup must be lengthened, as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
secures a firmer and more easy seat. This
leather will be of the correct length when, by a
little pressure on it with her foot, and a simultaneous
straightening of her knee, the rider can
spring upward about four or five inches from
the saddle; but it must never be so long as to
render the third pommel nearly, if not quite,
useless.</p>

<p>It is better to have the first lessons in riding
rather short, so that the pupil may become
gradually accustomed to the exercise. As soon
as she begins to feel at all fatigued, she should
at once dismount, and not try to ride again until
the tired feeling is wholly gone. These intervals
of fatigue will gradually become less and
less frequent, until at last the rider will find
herself so strong and vigorous that riding will
no longer require any fatiguing effort. In the
case of an active, healthy woman, accustomed
to exercise of various kinds, these short preliminary
lessons may not be necessary; her muscles
will be already so well developed that she will
not be easily fatigued by exercise of any kind.
But for a lady who has always been physically
inactive, these short lessons at first are absolutely
necessary. The general system of such
a person has become enfeebled, her muscles are
weak and flabby, and any sudden or long continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
exercise would tend to produce very injurious
results, so that riding, unless begun
very gradually, would probably do her more
harm than good.</p>

<p>But after reading all the directions just given
about riding, the reader may ask what need
there is of so much study and circumspection
to enable a woman to mount a horse and ride
him, when hundreds of ladies ride every day,
and enjoy doing so, without knowing anything
about the make of the saddle, or the position
they ought to take when seated in it.</p>

<p>Although it seems almost a pity to disturb
the serenity and self-complacency of ignorance,
we shall be obliged, in justice to those who
really wish to understand the principles of good
horsewomanship, to point out some of the mistakes
of those who think that riding is an accomplishment
which can be acquired without
instruction and study.</p>

<p>It is not too sweeping an assertion to state
that, of one hundred ladies who attempt a display
of what they consider their <i>excellent</i> horsewomanship
in our streets and parks, ninety-five
are very imperfect riders; and the five who do
ride well have only learned to do so by means
of careful study and competent instruction.
They have fully appreciated the fact that nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
never ushered them into the world finished
riders, any more than accomplished grammarians
or Latin scholars, and that although one
may possess a natural aptitude for an accomplishment,
application, study, and practice are
positively necessary to enable her to attain any
degree of perfection in it. Yet the idea unfortunately
prevails very largely in this country
that women require very little instruction to
become good riders, and the results of this belief
are apparent in the ninety-five faulty riders
already referred to.</p>

<p>Let us now watch some of the fair Americans
whom the first balmy day of spring has tempted
out for a horseback ride, and notice the faulty
positions in which they have contrived to seat
themselves in their saddles. With regard to
their beauty, elegance of form, and style of
dress, nothing more could be desired; but, alas!
the same cannot be said of their manner of riding.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 21.&mdash;Crooked Position in Saddle.<br />
Miss X.</p>
</div>

<p>Take Miss X. and Mrs. Y., for examples.
These ladies have the reputation of being fine
and fearless horsewomen, and certainly do ride
with that dash and confidence which long practice
in the saddle is sure to give, but we regret
to say that we can bestow no further praise
upon them. Miss X. has taken a position that
is almost universal with American horsewomen,
and is exactly the one which a rider nearly always
assumes when seated sideways on a horse
without a saddle. Instead of sitting squarely,
with the entire front of her body facing in the
direction toward which the horse is going, she
sits crosswise. It will be seen by looking at
<a href="#Fig_21" class="inref">Fig. 21</a>, that the central vertical line of her
back, instead of being directly in the centre of
the saddle, is placed toward the right corner of
it, and that her shoulders are out of line, the
left one being thrown back, and the right one
advanced forward. This position makes it impossible
for her to keep in unison with her horse
when he is moving straight forward at an easy
pace. When he changes his gait to a canter
the rider will, for a short distance, appear to be
more in harmony with him, because he is now
turning himself slightly to the left and leading
with his right fore-leg, a position which is more
in unison with that of his rider. But, after a
short time, the horse gets tired of this canter,
turns to the right, and leads with his left fore-leg.
This change entirely destroys the apparent
harmony which had before existed between
the two.</p>

<p>The lady, knowing nothing about the position
of a horse when galloping or cantering, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
ignorant of the fact that he always turns a little
to the right or left according to the leg with
which he leads, and that she ought to place her
body in a corresponding position. She has but
one position in the saddle,&mdash;the crooked one
already described,&mdash;and this she maintains immovably
through all the changes of her horse's
gaits.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_22"></a>
<img src="images/fig22.jpg" width="220" height="450" alt="Fig. 22.&mdash;Crooked Position in Saddle. Mrs. Y." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 22.&mdash;Crooked Position in Saddle.<br />
Mrs. Y.</p>
</div>

<p>Let us now turn to Mrs. Y., who is even a
more faulty rider than her companion. She
has likewise taken a crosswise position in the
saddle; but having given a peculiar twist to
her body so that, by turning her right shoulder
backward, she can look to the right, she seems
to imagine that by these means she has placed
herself squarely upon the saddle. (<a href="#Fig_22" class="inref">Fig. 22.</a>) As
she is riding a racking horse and seated on a two-pommeled
saddle, she holds the reins firmly in her
left hand and by a steady pull on them she balances
herself and keeps her horse up to his gait.
But this steady pull will soon ruin the tenderness
and sensitiveness of any horse's mouth, and
this is the reason why racking horses generally
have very hard mouths, many of them requiring
to be well held up or supported in their rack by
the reins. As this pulling upon the reins also
gives considerable support to the rider, many
ladies prefer a racking horse. Now notice Mrs.
Y., who is attempting to turn her hard-mouthed
racker. Instead of doing this by an almost
imperceptible movement of the hand, her left
hand and arm can be distinctly seen to move,
and to fairly pull the animal around. Her right
hand&mdash;probably acting in sympathy with the
left, so tightly clasped over the reins&mdash;holds
the whip as if it were in a vise intended to
crush it. In odd contrast with the rigidly held
hands is the body with its utter lack of firmness.</p>

<p>It can be seen at a glance why the lady will
only ride an easy racker, for it is well known
that on a good racker or pacer the body of a
rider in a faulty position is not jolted so much
as in other gaits. For this reason also the rack
and pace are the favorite gaits of most American
horsewomen.</p>

<p>Nearly every lady who rides has an ambition
to be considered a finished horsewoman, but this
she can never be until she is able to ride properly
the trot and gallop, can keep herself in
unison with her horse, whether he leads with
the left or right fore-leg, and has hands that
will "give and take" with the horse's movements
and bring him up to his best gait. From
this point of view, Miss X. and Mrs. Y., then,
are by no means the "splendid riders" that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a><br /><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
their friends suppose them, but having all the
confidence of ignorance they ride fast and boldly
and with a certain <i>abandon</i> that is pleasing;
but by those who understand what good riding
is, they must always be regarded as very faulty
riders.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_23"></a>
<img src="images/fig23.jpg" width="314" height="350" alt="Fig. 23.&mdash;Incorrect position of legs and feet. Side view." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 23.&mdash;Incorrect position of legs and feet.<br /> Side view.</p>
</div>

<p>Another common fault, against which we have
already warned the reader, is that of riding
with too short a stirrup-leather, thus pressing
the left knee up against the third pommel,
carrying the left heel backward and slightly
upward, and dropping the toes of the left foot
more or less down toward the ground, while
those of the right are raised and pointed toward
the horse's head. (<a href="#Fig_23" class="inref">Fig. 23.</a>) Although the
lower limbs are concealed by the skirt, it can
easily be told whether they are in the position
just described, from the effect produced upon
the upper part of the body, which then leans
too far forward and too much to the right
(<a href="#Fig_24" class="inref">Fig. 24</a>); while the rider, in her efforts to
balance herself, inclines her shoulders to the
left. This is a very awkward as well as a very
dangerous attitude, because, by thrusting her
leg backwards, the action of spurring is imitated,
and, if the horse is very high-spirited,
this may cause him to become restive, or even
to run away. Should the leg, moreover, as is
very apt to be the case, be firmly and steadily
pressed against the animal's side, he may suddenly
pirouette or turn around to the right,
especially if he has been accustomed to carrying
gentlemen as well as ladies. This short stirrup-leather
and improper use of the third pommel
should be carefully avoided.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_24"></a>
<img src="images/fig24.jpg" width="207" height="450" alt="Fig. 24.&mdash;Incorrect Position when Legs and Feet are
wrongly placed." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 24.&mdash;Incorrect Position when Legs and Feet are wrongly placed.</p>
</div>

<p>The use of too long a stirrup-leather is apt to
be the mistake of those who ride upon the old-fashioned
saddle, but is a fault which has become
much less common since the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a><br /><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
saddle has been more generally used. The objection
to too long a stirrup-leather is that,
when the foot is pressed upon it, the leg at the
same time is straightened, and extends down so
far as to cause the rider to sit too much to the
left of the saddle. As the pressure and weight
are thus thrown wholly upon the left side, the
saddle is very likely to turn, and if this faulty
position be persisted in, it will be certain to injure
the horse's back and may give rise to fistulous
withers.</p>

<p>Besides looking very awkward and inelegant,
when stooping forward in the saddle and rounding
the back without the slightest curve inwardly,
the rider will also run great risk, if her
horse stumbles or makes any sudden movement,
of being unseated, or at least thrown violently
against the front of the saddle, as it is almost
impossible for her, under such circumstances,
to adapt herself to the change in his motion
quickly enough to preserve her equilibrium. In
all violent movements of the horse, except rearing,
the body must be inclined backward, so as
to keep the balance. When he is moving briskly
in his ordinary gaits, the body must be kept
erect; and when he is turning a corner rapidly,
it should be inclined backward somewhat, and
toward the inner bend of the horse's body; or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in other words, toward the centre of the circle,
of which the turn forms a segment.</p>

<p>Here come two ladies who have evidently received
very limited instructions in the art of
riding. Notice how the head of one is thrust
forward, while the other, though holding her
head erect allows it to be jerked about with
every motion of her horse. It shakes slowly
when the animal is walking, but as he quickens
his pace to a canter, it rocks with his motion,
and, during his fast pace, the poor head
moves so rapidly as to make one fear that the
neck may become dislocated, while the arms
dance about simultaneously with the movements
of the head in a way that reminds one of the
toy dancing-jacks, pulled by an unseen hand for
the amusement of children. The head should,
in riding, be kept firm and erect, without stiffness,
the chin being drawn in slightly, and not
protruding high in the air, because the latter
gives one a supercilious look. The head and
shoulders should adapt themselves, in their direction,
to the movements of the head and fore-legs
of the horse, and the arms should be held
as steady as possible.</p>

<p>But here come several ladies who have taken
lessons at the riding-school and may, therefore,
reasonably be expected to be finished riders;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
but such, alas! is not the case. They have
been trying "to walk before they could creep,"
or, in other words, their lessons in riding have
been conducted too hastily. They have begun
to try a canter or a rapid gallop before they
knew how to sit correctly upon their horses, or
even to manage them properly in a walk. This
desire to make too rapid progress is more frequently
the fault of the pupil than of the riding
teacher. Most teachers have an ambition to
make finished riders of their pupils, and take
much pride in doing so, especially as such a result
adds greatly to the prestige of their school.
This ambition is often defeated, however, by the
impatience of the pupils, who are not satisfied
to learn slowly and well, but overrule the
teacher's objections and undertake to gallop before
they have acquired even the first principles
of horsewomanship. Moreover, many of these
ladies never take any road lessons, so highly
important to all who would become thoroughly
accomplished in this art; nor do they remain
long enough under instruction in the school,
but seem to think that a few short lessons are
enough to make them finished riders. They
often refuse to learn the English trot, although
this is a very important accomplishment for the
beginner, as it enables her to gain a correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
idea of the balance. Or, if they do attempt to
learn it, they insist upon circling only to the
right, as this is easier than going the other way.</p>

<p>Again, many pupils will insist upon riding
the same favorite horse, instead of leaving the
selection to the judgment of the teacher, who is
well aware that it is much better for the lady's
progress that she should ride a variety of horses
with different gaits. He is often driven to his
wit's end when two or three ladies who patronize
his school, and whom it is an honor to have
as pupils, express a desire to ride the same
horse on the same occasion. Should he favor
one more than the others, the latter will become
highly offended, and the poor man in his perplexity
is often obliged to resort to some subterfuge
to pacify them.</p>

<p>It is not difficult, then, to understand why
some ladies, although they have taken lessons
at a riding-school, are, nevertheless, not finished
riders, their faults being due, not to the instruction
but to their own lack of judgment or
inattention. It is true that occasionally the
teacher, although he may be an excellent instructor
for gentlemen, is not so good a one for
ladies, or he may become careless, believing
that if he gives them well-trained horses to ride
very little else is required of him. Or, again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
he may think, as many foreigners do, that very
few American ladies know how a woman should
ride, and are satisfied with being half taught.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly impressed upon riding
teachers that in every riding-school where
ladies are to be taught there should be at least
one lady assistant. A gentleman can give all
the necessary instructions about the management
of the horse and the handling of the reins
better than most ladies; but, in giving the idea
of a correct seat and the proper disposal of the
limbs, the presence of a lady assistant becomes
necessary; in these matters she can instruct her
own sex much better than a man can.</p>

</div>


<p>The position of the rider in the saddle has a
decided influence upon the horse's mouth, rendering
his movements regular or irregular, according
to the correctness and firmness of the
seat; for, if the rider be unsteady or vacillating
in the saddle, this will exert an influence upon
the hand, rendering it correspondingly unstable,
and will thereby cause the horse's movements
to be variable. And should she endeavor to
remedy this unsteadiness of hand and seat by
supporting herself upon the reins, the horse
will defend himself against such rigid traction
by making counter-traction upon the reins,
thrusting his head forward, throwing himself
heavily upon his fore-legs, thus forcing the
hands of the rider, and compelling her to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the weight of his neck and shoulders. On
the contrary, if she be firm in her seat, and not
in the least dependent upon the reins, her hand
will be light, and the animal will yield a ready
obedience and advance in his best pace. The
preceding remarks explain why a horse will go
lightly with one rider and heavily with another.</p>

<p>A lady should have a thorough knowledge of
the management of her horse, and of the means
by which she may command him in every degree
of speed, and under all circumstances;
without this knowledge she can never become a
safe and accomplished horsewoman. A gentleman
may guide and control his horse, and obtain
obedience from a restive one, by a firm,
strong hand, and by his courage and determined
will; but as a rule, a lady cannot depend upon
these methods; she will have to rely entirely
upon the thorough training of her horse, a
properly arranged bit, her firm, yet delicate
touch, and her skill in handling the reins.
The well-trained hand of a woman is always
energetic enough to obtain the mastery of
her horse, without having to resort to feats
of strength and acrobatic movements; and
a <i>lady</i> should never seek to gain prestige by
riding restless or vicious horses, in order that
she may display her skill in conquering them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
though every rider should be thoroughly
taught how to control her steed in cases of
emergency.</p>

<p>When one sees how little skill most lady
riders exhibit in managing the reins, it seems
almost miraculous that so few accidents occur
to them, and is indeed a positive proof of
the excellent temper of their horses. From
some mysterious cause, most horses will bear
more awkwardness and absurdity in the handling
of the reins by a woman than by a man,
and will good-naturedly submit to the indifferent
riding of the gentle being in the side-saddle,
while the same character of riding and
treatment from a man would arouse every feeling
of defense and rebellion. The probable
cause of this difference of action on the part
of the horse is, that a lady rider, with all her
ignorance of seat and rein, will talk kindly to
and pet her steed, and will rarely lose her temper,
no matter in what eccentricities he may
indulge, and her gentleness causes the animal
to remain gentle.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when a man throws his
weight upon the reins, jerking and pulling
upon them, his horse, seeking to defend himself
against such rough measures, arouses the temper
of his rider, and this anger is soon communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to the animal, which then becomes obstinate
and rebellious; moreover, a man will
often whip and spur for some trivial offense in
instances where a woman would simply speak to
her horse, or take no notice. Hence, the ignorant
horsewoman often rides in safety under
circumstances in which the ignorant horseman,
who has resorted to violent measures, meets
with an accident.</p>

<p>Although a horse may submit to an awkward
rider and carry her with safety, still she
will have no power to make him move in his
best and most regular manner, and there will
exist no intelligence or harmony between the
two. Yet this same horse, when mounted by
a lady who understands the <b>management of
the reins</b>, will be all animation and happiness.
There will soon be established a tacit
understanding between the two, and the graceful
curvetings and prancings of the steed will
manifest his pride and joy in carrying and
obeying a gentle woman, who manages the reins
with spirit and resolution, and yet does not,
with the cruelty of ignorance or indifference,
convert them into instruments of torture.</p>

<p>The <b>reins</b> should not be employed until a
firm, steady position upon the saddle has been
acquired, and then, for first lessons, the snaffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
only should be used, <b>a rein in each hand</b>.
It will be better to have the reins marked at
equal distances from the bit, either by sewing
colored thread across each, or otherwise; this
will be useful because, with the novice, the
reins will imperceptibly slip through her hands,
or one rein will become longer than the other,
and the markings will enable her to notice
these displacements, and promptly to remedy
them. By holding the snaffle-reins separately,
in first lessons, the pupil will be aided in assuming
a square position upon the saddle, and
will likewise be prevented from throwing back
her right shoulder, out of line with the left, a
common fault with beginners, especially when
the reins are held only in the left hand. This
rein-hold is very simple; the right rein of the
snaffle must be held in the right hand, and the
left rein in the left.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_25"></a>
<img src="images/fig25.jpg" width="443" height="200" alt="Fig. 25.&mdash;Snaffle-reins; one in each hand." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 25.&mdash;Snaffle-reins; one in each hand.</p>
</div>

<p>The hands being closed, but not too tightly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
must be held with their backs toward the
horse's head, and each rein, as it ascends from
the bit, must be passed between the third and
fourth fingers of its appropriate hand, carried
across the inner surface of the third, second,
and first fingers, and then be drawn over the
outside (or side next to the thumb) of the first
finger, against which it must be held by firm
pressure of the thumb. The thumbs must be
held opposite each other and uppermost, the finger-nails
toward the body, and the back of the
wrists must be rounded a little outwardly, so
as to make a slight bend of the closed hand
toward the body. The little fingers must be
held down and nearly in a horizontal line with
the tips of the elbows; and the hands be kept
as low as possible, without resting upon the
knees, and be about four inches distant from
the body, and from four to six inches apart.
(<a href="#Fig_25" class="inref">Fig. 25.</a>)</p>

<p>This arrangement of hands and reins may
be termed the "original position" when a snaffle-rein
is held in each hand, of which all the
others are variations. In this position,&mdash;the
reins being held just short enough to feel the
horse's mouth,&mdash;if the hands be now slightly
relaxed by turning the nails and thumbs toward
the body, the latter being, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
time, inclined a little forward, the horse will be
enabled to advance freely, and, as soon as he
<b>moves onward</b>, the original position of the
hands must be gently resumed. It is proper to
remark here, that when using the snaffle-reins
only, the curb-bit should always be in the
horse's mouth, its reins being tied and allowed
to rest upon his neck, although the pupil must
not be allowed to meddle with it. The presence
of the curb in the horse's mouth, although not
used, has a restraining influence, especially with
an animal accustomed to it.</p>

<p><b>To turn the horse to the right</b>, the right rein
must be shortened so as to be felt at the right
side of his mouth; to effect this, the little finger
of the right hand must, by a turn of the wrist,
be moved in toward the body and sufficiently
toward the left, with the nails up and the
knuckles down, while, in order to aid the horse,
the rider will simultaneously turn her face and
shoulders slightly to the right. The animal
having made the turn, the hand must gently
return to the original position, and the body
again face to the front.</p>

<p><b>To turn the horse to the left</b>, the left rein
must be shortened, by a turn of the left wrist,
carrying the little finger of the left hand toward
the body and to the right, nails upward, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
while the pupil will slightly turn her face and
shoulders to the left. The turn having been
effected, the original position must be resumed,
the pupil, in all these cases, taking great care
that the markings on her reins are even and in
the correct position.</p>

<p><b>To stop the horse</b>, both reins must be shortened
evenly; this must be accomplished by a
turn of both wrists that will bring the little
fingers toward the body with the finger-nails
uppermost, the body of the pupil being, at the
same time, slightly inclined backward. Now,
by bending the wrists to a still greater degree,
and bringing the hands in closer to the body,
which must be inclined a little forward, and
nearly in contact with each other, thus throwing
more strength upon the reins, the horse will be
compelled <b>to back</b>. To make him <b>move on
again</b>, the hands and body must resume the
original position, and the hands must be relaxed,
etc., as stated above.</p>

<p>When the pupil becomes more advanced, and
can command her horse, in all his gaits, with
the reins separate, one in each hand, she will
then be prepared for lessons in handling <b>both
reins with the left hand</b> only, still employing
the snaffle, as her touch may not be delicate
enough for the curb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_26"></a>
<img src="images/fig26.jpg" width="357" height="199" alt="Fig. 26.&mdash;Snaffle-reins; both in the left
hand." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 26.&mdash;Snaffle-reins; both in the left hand.</p>
</div>

<p>For this purpose, the reins being held for the
time being in the
right hand, the
left, having its
back toward the
horse's head, will
seize them as follows:
its little
finger must be
passed directly
between the two reins, the left rein being on
the outer side of this finger and the right one
on its right side, between it and the third finger.
This done, the reins must be drawn up
nearly even to the marks upon them,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> so as just
to feel the animal's mouth, noticing that these
marks are nearly on a line with each other,
while that portion of the reins lying within the
hand must be carried across its palm to the
index finger, to a point between its first and
second joints, against which point, being placed
evenly with one overlying the other, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to be firmly held by pressure of the thumb;
the right hand may now quit its hold upon the
reins. (<a href="#Fig_26" class="inref">Fig. 26.</a>)</p>

<p>The reins having been properly placed in the
left hand according to the directions just given,
this hand, being closed, but not too tightly,
must be held at a distance of about three inches
from the front part of the waist, with the wrist
slightly rounded, the nails toward the body, the
back of the hand toward the horse's head, and
the little finger down and a little nearer the
body than the others. The under surface of the
bridle arm and hand, from the tip of the elbow
to the first joint of the little finger, should be
held nearly in a horizontal line. The elbow
must be held somewhat close to the side but
not in contact with it, and should be kept steady.
Care must be taken, when the reins are held in
the left hand, that the right shoulder be not
thrown back, nor the left one elevated, faulty
positions common to beginners when not otherwise
instructed. The right arm should be
allowed to hang easily and steadily at the side,
the whip being lightly held in it, with its point
downward. When the snaffle-reins are held in
the left hand as described, we may term this
the "original position," of which all the others
are variations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>In order that the horse may <b>move onward</b>,
the left hand, holding the reins as just described,
should be relaxed by turning the thumb downward
and toward the body until the back of
the hand is up and the finger-nails down; at
the same time, the pupil should slightly incline
her body forward, being careful not to round
the shoulders,&mdash;aiding the movement by the
voice, or, if necessary, by a gentle tap of the
whip. The horse having started onward, the
original position must be gently resumed.</p>

<p>In order to <b>turn the horse to the right</b>, the
left wrist must be turned so as to bring the nails
down and the knuckles up,&mdash;the thumb being
toward the body,&mdash;at the same time carrying
the little finger slightly to the left, and drawing
the reins a little upward. This movement will
effect the necessary shortening of the right rein,
without allowing any looseness of the left one.
The turn having been accomplished, the hand
must resume the original position. It must not
be forgotten, that while making this turn the
face and shoulders must be turned somewhat to
the right, or in the direction in which the horse
is moving.</p>

<p><b>To turn to the left</b>, the bridle-hand being in
the original position, its wrist must be turned so
as to carry the finger-nails up, and the knuckles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
down, simultaneously moving the little finger
toward the right and pressing it against the left
rein, both reins being drawn slightly upward.
This man&oelig;uvre shortens the left rein, without
relaxing the right. In this turn the movements
of the horse should be aided by the rider's face
and shoulders being turned a little to the left.
The turn having been made, the original position
must be resumed.</p>

<p>The horse <b>may be stopped</b> by simply turning
the wrist so as to carry the finger-nails up,
the knuckles down, and the little finger toward
the body, which must be slightly inclined backward.
Now, by bracing the muscles of the
hand, bending the wrist and carrying the hand
farther in toward the waist, at the same time
advancing the body, the animal will be made
<b>to back</b>; though, in backing a horse, it will be
better to employ both hands. After having
stopped, or backed the horse, to make him
<b>move onward</b>, a course should be pursued,
with both reins in the bridle-hand, similar to
that described for the same purpose when a
rein is held in each hand.</p>

<p><b>To change the snaffle-reins from the left
to the right hand</b>, as is sometimes necessary
in order to adjust the skirt, to relieve the left
hand, etc., the following course must be pursued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
whether the horse be in rapid or slow
motion: While the left hand must retain its
position and gentle pressure of the reins upon
the horse's mouth, the right must be carried to
and over the left hand, its forefinger be passed
between the two reins, so that the left rein will
be on the left side of this finger, and the right
on its right side, between the first and second
fingers; both reins must now be carried to the
right, across the palm, to the little finger; the
hand must then be firmly closed, and the thumb
be pressed against the left rein, holding it in
contact with the index finger,&mdash;the left hand
now gives up the reins. In this change, while
the right hand is being carried over to the left,
this latter must be held stationary, as any movement
of it to meet the right hand may cause
the animal to turn or swerve from his course,
and will at the same time interfere with his
gait.</p>

<p><b>To return the reins to the left hand</b>, the
following course must be pursued: While the
right hand must remain steady and sustain the
gait of the horse, the left must be carried to
and over it, insert its little finger between the
two reins, so that the left one will be on the left
or outer side of this finger, and the right one
on its right side, between it and the third finger;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
then the reins must be drawn through
the left hand, and be arranged and held in this
hand in the same manner as explained when
describing the original position of both snaffle-reins
in the bridle-hand.</p>

<p>These various changes must be made quickly
and expertly, without altering the degree of
pressure or pull upon the horse's mouth. The
novice will find it greatly to her advantage to
learn the management of the reins before mounting
the horse, and can do so by fastening the
bit-end of the reins to some stationary object,
and then practicing the different changes, until
she can perform all these man&oelig;uvres without
looking at her hands or the reins.</p>

<p>When both the reins are held in the left
hand, the rider has not so much command over
her horse as when they are held one in each
hand. For this reason, unless her steed be exceptionally
well-trained and obedient, it will be
better, when in a crowded thoroughfare, where
quick turns have to be made, to hold a rein in
each hand, and this will become absolutely necessary
if the animal be hard mouthed or unruly.</p>

<p>When the horse is in motion and the reins are
held in the left hand, their <b>separation</b> may be
quickly effected by carrying the right hand to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and over the left, the latter retaining its steadiness
all the time, and then passing the first three
fingers of the right hand between the two reins,
so that they may readily close upon the right
rein; the thumb will then keep this rein firm
by pressing it against the first joint of the index
finger. The position of the hands and reins will
then, after a movement of the left little finger
to place the rein between it and the third, be
the same as described for the original position
where a snaffle-rein is held in each hand.</p>

<p>Should the reins become too long when held
separately, they can readily <b>be shortened</b> by
returning the right rein to the bridle-hand,
placing it directly over the left rein between
the third and little finger, and then, by means
of the right hand, drawing the loose rein or
reins through the bridle-hand to the proper
length, after which the right rein may again be
taken in the right hand, as already described.</p>

<p>When the reins are held in one hand, they
can be <b>shortened or lengthened</b> by simply
seizing them at their free, disengaged ends with
the right hand, and while this holds them and
sustains the horse, the left hand must be slipped
along the reins, up or down, as may be required,
but without changing their arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Another way of holding the reins in the bridle-hand
is to pass the right rein to the right
of, and underneath, the index finger, and then
carry it across the palm, so as to escape beyond
the little finger; while the left rein must be
passed to the left of the little finger (or between
it and the third finger), and then be
carried across the palm to escape beyond the index
finger. The author cannot recommend this
manner of holding the reins to ladies who desire
to become accomplished and graceful riders, because
the movements of the hands and arms,
when turning, or managing the horse, are much
more conspicuous; and there is not that delicate
correspondence with the animal's mouth
that can be obtained by the other methods described.</p>

<p>After the pupil has become expert in riding
with the snaffle, she will be ready for the <b>double
bridle</b>, or the <b>curb-bit and bridoon</b>. The
double bridle must be <b>held in the left hand</b> in
the following manner: The <i>bridoon</i> or <i>snaffle-reins</i>
are first to be taken up, evenly, by the
right hand and then the second finger of the
left hand be passed between these reins (the
left rein being between the second and third
fingers, and the right rein between the first and
second), the back of the hand being directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
somewhat upward, with the knuckles toward
the horse's head; the reins should then be
pulled up by the right hand just enough to feel
the horse's mouth, and carried across the palm
to the index finger, where they should be held
in position by firm pressure with the thumb.</p>

<p class="bigpic"><a href="images/fig27-large.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>curb-reins</i> are now to be taken evenly
by the right hand, and then the little finger of
the left hand be passed between the two reins,
the left rein being upon the left or outer side
of the little finger, and the right rein between
the little and third fingers; both curb-reins
should next be drawn upward by the right
hand until they are nearly the length of the
snaffle, and carried across the palm, one rein
overlying the other, to the index finger, between
its first and second joints, and between
the snaffle-reins and the thumb, at which point
all the reins must be firmly held by pressure
of the thumb against them; the right hand will
now remove its hold. (<a href="#Fig_27" class="inref">Fig. 27.</a>) The above
man&oelig;uvring of the reins will give the "original
position" for the double bridle in the left
hand. All these reins should be of nearly equal
length, the snaffle being slightly the shortest,
so that, while riding with the latter, the curb
may be ready for instant use; this may be
brought into play by simply turning the wrist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
so as to carry the little finger up and toward
the waist. And the full power of the curb
may be brought into action by turning the
wrist so as to carry the knuckles down and the
nails up, at the same time drawing the little
finger toward the waist.</p>


<p><b>To shorten or lengthen both the curb and
snaffle reins evenly</b> without abandoning the
horse to himself for a moment, or without ceasing
to keep up his action,
the following method may
be pursued: The loose, disengaged
ends of all the
reins that extend beyond
the index finger of the left
hand must be taken between
the thumb and forefinger
of the right hand, care being taken during
this man&oelig;uvre to keep up the support to
the horse with this hand; the grasp of the left
hand upon the reins must now be sufficiently
relaxed to allow this hand to slide along the
reins downward to shorten them, or upward to
lengthen them; this must be effected without
deranging their adjustment; when the proper
range has been obtained, remove the right
hand.</p>

<p><b>To shorten the curb and lengthen the</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<b>snaffle-reins</b>: The loose, disengaged ends of
all the reins must be held in the same manner
as stated in the preceding paragraph, between
the thumb and index finger of the right hand,
not omitting to keep up a support to the horse;
the grasp of the left hand must now be slightly
relaxed, and this hand be slid up along all the
reins, which movement will lengthen them in
the left hand. The grasp of the right hand upon
the snaffle-reins must now be relaxed, and the
left hand be slid down along the curb-reins, carrying
the snaffle-reins with it, until the proper
range or distance has been attained, when the
right hand may be removed. While these
changes are being made, the right hand must
sustain the horse by the curb-reins until the left
has obtained a firm hold upon all.</p>

<p><b>To shorten the snaffle and lengthen the
curb reins</b>, a course similar to the one just preceding
must be pursued, except that in this case
the right hand must retain the snaffle-reins, and
support the horse by them, while the left hand,
in sliding down, will carry those of the curb.
In all these changes of the various reins, it must
be remembered that after each change has been
effected the reins must be held in place by firm
pressure of the thumb, as already described.</p>

<p>When <b>either of the reins</b> held in the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
hand <b>becomes loose</b>, it may be tightened, by
carrying the right hand to and over the left
one, seizing the loose rein by its disengaged end
that hangs loosely from the left index finger,
and drawing it up as far as is necessary. While
this is being done, the left hand must not be
removed from its position, and should continue
to keep up a steady pressure upon the horse's
mouth.</p>

<p>In requiring the horse <b>to stop</b>, <b>to back</b>, <b>to
turn</b>, or <b>to advance</b>, the management of the
double bridle-reins will be exactly the same as
stated in the directions given when holding the
snaffle-reins in the left hand.</p>

<p>When both <b>the curb and the snaffle reins</b>
are held in the bridle-hand, they may be <b>changed
to the right hand</b>, when this is desired, as follows:
The right hand must be carried to the
left; the second finger of the right hand must
be placed between the snaffle-reins (already separated
by the second finger of the left hand);
and the little finger of the right hand between
the curb-reins (already separated by the little
finger of the left hand); this done, the thumb
and fingers of the right hand must be closed
upon the reins, which must, at the same time,
be released by the left hand.</p>

<p><b>To restore these reins to the left hand</b>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
pupil must proceed as follows: Carrying the
left hand to the right, the second finger of the
left hand must be placed between the snaffle-reins,
and the little finger of this hand between
the curb-reins; this having been done, the
thumb and fingers must be closed upon all the
reins, while the right hand releases its hold.
These several changes can be made whether
the horse be moving slowly or rapidly, care being
taken to effect them so quietly that the
horse will not be abandoned to himself from
want of support, nor interrupted in the rhythm
of his gait.</p>

<p>If when riding with the double bridle in the
bridle-hand, very quick turns have to be made,
or when the horse will not yield readily to the
movements of the bridle-hand, it will become
necessary to <b>separate the reins</b> by taking that
of the right snaffle in the right hand; this can
be quickly effected by carrying the right hand to
and over the left, and seizing the right snaffle-rein
with the first three fingers of the right
hand; this rein will pass between the third and
little fingers and across the palm, so that the
loose, disengaged end will escape from between
the thumb and forefinger.</p>

</div>

<p>In America, most lady riders prefer to guide
the horse with the bridle-hand only; in doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
this, although they may appear more careless
and graceful, they certainly lose much command
over the animal. The method at present employed
by the
best European
horsewomen,
who <i>seldom ride
with the reins
in the left hand
alone</i>, is as follows: The little finger of the
right hand is to be passed between the right curb
and snaffle reins in such a way that the curb-rein
will be on the outer side of this finger, and
the snaffle between it and the third finger; both
reins must then be carried across the palm, and
be firmly held by the thumb against the forefinger.
The little finger of the left hand is
also to be passed between the left snaffle and
curb reins, in a similar manner to that just described,
and the reins must be held firm by the
thumb and forefinger of this hand. (<a href="#Fig_28" class="inref">Fig. 28.</a>)
This arrangement may be termed the "original
position" for a curb and snaffle rein in each
hand.</p>

<p>When the reins are thus separated, the action
upon the horse's mouth will be much more powerful
than when they are all placed in the bridle-hand.
They should be held nearly even,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the snaffle being somewhat shorter than the
curb, so that the hold or pressure upon the animal's
mouth may be made by the former; but
should it be required on any occasion to employ
the curb, this can be brought into instant use
by a slight turn of the wrists, that will carry
the little fingers up and toward the rider's
waist. To <i>stop</i>, to <i>back</i>, to <i>turn</i>, or to <i>advance</i>,
the reins must be managed in the same way
as when one snaffle-rein alone is held in each
hand. In all these various ways of holding the
double bridle, the snaffle-reins should, as they
pass upward from the bit, always be placed
above those of the curb; indeed, it would be
rather awkward to hold them otherwise.</p>

<p>As already stated, when the object for which
any change of hands and reins has been made
is effected, the hands should always resume the
original position, as explained for the snaffle-reins
when one is held in each hand,&mdash;thus,
hands four inches from the body, four inches
apart, etc. The arms and elbows must be kept
as steady as possible, all movements of the reins
being made with the wrists and fingers, unless
the horse be hard mouthed or badly trained,
when the arms will have to be employed and
more force will be required. But a horse of
this kind should never be ridden by a woman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and the directions herein given will be found
amply sufficient to control a well-trained, properly-bitted
animal.</p>

<p>The preceding directions relative to holding
and managing the reins may appear very tedious
and exceedingly complicated. But if the
pupil, commencing with the snaffle-reins, one in
each hand, will carefully study and practice
each method in succession, she will soon find
that all these apparently difficult man&oelig;uvres
are very simple when put into practice, and
can be readily learned in half a dozen lessons.
When she has once fully mastered them, she
will be astonished to find how little management,
when it is of the right kind and based upon correct
principles, will be required to make her
steed move in an easy and pleasant manner.</p>

<p>After the rein-hold has been acquired, and
the pupil properly seated in the saddle, she will,
if the reins are held steady, observe with each
step of the horse as he advances in the canter
or gallop, a slight tug or pull upon the reins.
This pull will also be simultaneously felt by the
horse's mouth, between which and the rider's
hand or hands there will be what may be termed
a <b>correspondence</b>. This correspondence gives
a <i>support</i> to the horse, provided the rider, while
maintaining an equal degree of tension upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
reins, will "<b>give and take</b>," or, in other words,
will allow the movements of the bridle-hand to
concur with those of this tug or pull. A <i>dead
pull</i> may be made by bracing the muscles of the
hand, tightly closing the fingers upon the reins,
and holding the hand immovable; but this
should never be done, except to convey some
imperative command to the horse, or when he
attempts to gain the ascendency. This kind of
pull will interfere with the natural movements
of the horse's head, making him move in a confined,
irregular manner, and will oblige him to
<i>force the rider's hand</i> or <i>hands;</i> that is, in order
to relieve himself from this restraint, he
will give a sudden downward jerk of his head,
which may take the reins from her hands, unless
she be upon her guard; or else he will move
heavily upon his fore-legs, and make his rider
support the weight of his head and neck.</p>

<p>Should the curb be used instead of the snaffle,
the result may be still worse; because when the
curb-reins are pulled upon, the port or arched
part of the bit will come in contact with the
roof of the animal's mouth, and will press upon
it to a degree corresponding to the power used
upon the reins, while the curb-chain will be
forced against the lower jaw, and if this continual
pressure or dead pull be kept up the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
will experience considerable pain. To relieve
himself, he will suddenly throw his head either
up or down and may even rear. In the latter
case, if his rider does not instantly relax her
hand, he will be apt to fall backward, which is
one of the most serious accidents that can happen
when riding. If this rigid pull upon the
curb be continued, the horse will be certain,
ultimately, to become hard mouthed, if not
vicious. This is a reason why so many riders,
though having the double bridle-reins, use only
the snaffle, and allow the curb-reins to hang
quite loosely, being afraid to employ them, as
experience has taught them that this rigid hold
upon the reins will be instantly resented by the
horse. Hence the curb-reins appear to be attached
to the head-gear of their horses more as
an article of ornament than of utility.</p>

<p>In order that a lady's horse may move lightly
and well upon his haunches, the curb will have
to be employed occasionally to <i>collect</i> and <i>restrain</i>
him; and when it is managed properly,
he will advance in better style than when the
snaffle alone is used. The snaffle will answer
a better purpose when employed to guide the
horse in turning completely around, or in
movements to the right or to the left; while
the curb will answer during a straightforward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
motion to keep the animal well up to his action
and to bring out his best gait, as well as to collect
and restrain him.</p>

<p>An easy "give and take" feeling can be effected
by slightly loosening or opening the fingers
of the bridle-hand or hands as the horse
springs forward; as the hand feels the pull upon
the reins, it must yield to this sensation, and
will thus allow the animal liberty in his spring
or advance movements. Then, as the action of
the horse lessens or recedes, the reins will be
felt to slacken, when the fingers should be
closed, which will tighten the reins, support the
animal, and keep him under control. This
"give and take" movement should occur alternately
and simultaneously with the cadence of
each step of the steed, and should be effected
without any backward or forward movements
of the arm or arms, which must be held steady,&mdash;except
in a rapid gallop, in which case both
the hand and arm will, to a certain extent, have
to move to and fro. In the "give and take"
movement the reins should not be allowed to
slip in the slightest degree, nor to be jerked
from the rider's hand by any sudden motion of
the horse's head; on the contrary, they should
always be held firm between the thumb and the
first and second joints of the index finger, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
<i>other fingers alone</i> performing the alternate action
of loosening and tightening the reins.</p>

<p>The reader will be better enabled to understand
this explanation if she will take a piece of
elastic, pass it around her right hand, which will
correspond to the horse's mouth, and then hold
the two ends in her left hand, exactly in the
manner explained for holding the double bridle-reins
in one hand. Now, by making tension
on the elastic (or reins) with the left hand, so
that the right (or supposed horse's mouth) can
just feel this pressure, a <i>correspondence</i> will be
formed between these two hands (or bridle-hand
and supposed horse's mouth) through which the
slightest movement of the left hand, or of its
second, third, or fourth fingers, will be immediately
felt by the right hand; then, while holding
the elastic (or reins) firmly, by pressure,
between the thumb and index finger, by alternately
opening and closing the fingers of the
left hand, she will observe that when her fingers
are closed there will be quite a tension
upon the elastic and consequently upon the
right hand, and when they are slightly opened
this will become flaccid. The relaxation and
contraction of the hand constitutes the "give
and take" movement, which causes the horse to
move easily, pleasantly, and with perfect freedom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
while at the same time he is kept in entire
obedience to his rider. Indeed, this movement
is <i>the grand secret of good riding and correct
management of the horse, and there can be no
good riding without it</i>.</p>

<p>With this movement there should always be
a certain support or pull upon the horse's
mouth,&mdash;firmer or lighter according to the
sensitiveness of his mouth, as some animals are
harder mouthed than others, and consequently
require a firmer support;&mdash;this tension or
pressure should be rather light in the walk and
canter, firmer in the trot, and very light in the
hand gallop. In the rapid gallop, the horse requires
considerable support.</p>

<p>In all cases of <i>restiveness</i>, except in rearing,
raising the bridle-hands will give more command
over the horse, as it will cause him to
keep up his head, and thus while lessening the
power of the animal will at the same time add
to that of the rider. On the contrary, should
the horse lower his head, and the bridle-hands
be held low, the power of the animal will be
augmented and he can bid defiance to his rider,
unless she can raise his head. She will have to
do this in a gentle but firm manner, soliciting,
as it were, the desired elevation of his head by
raising her hands and quickly relaxing and contracting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the fingers, but being careful to keep
the reins in place between the thumb and index
finger of each hand; she will thus gradually
oblige him to raise his neck with his chin drawn
in, so that control over his mouth may be regained.</p>

<p>Should he resist this method, the reins must
be momentarily slackened, and then a decided
jerk or pull be given them in an upward direction;
this will cause a sharp twinge in his
mouth, and make him raise his head. In these
man&oelig;uvres the curb-bit should be used, and as
the animal raises his head the rider should
gently relax the reins, and also be on her guard
lest he rear. In some instances a decided "sawing"
of his mouth with the snaffle&mdash;that is,
sharply pulling upon one rein and then upon
the other, and in rather quick succession&mdash;will
cause him to raise his head and neck.</p>

<p>When a horse is obedient, all changes in the
degree of pressure upon his mouth should be
made gradually, because, if a sudden transition
be made from a firm hand to a relaxed one, he
will be abruptly deprived of the support upon
which he has been depending and may be
thrown forward on his shoulders. Again, to
pass precipitately from a slack rein to a tight
one will give a violent shock to his mouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
cause him to displace his head, and destroy the
harmony of his movements. As a means of
punishment, some riders jerk suddenly, repeatedly,
and violently upon the reins; this "jagging
on the reins" is a great mistake, and will
be likely to result in more harm to the rider
than to the horse, as the latter may suddenly
rear, or else have a bad temper aroused that
will be difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>When riding on the road there will be times
when the horse will require more liberty of the
reins, as, for instance, when his head or neck
becomes uncomfortable from being kept too
long in one position, when he has an attack of
cough, when he wants to dislodge a troublesome
fly, etc. In giving this liberty when occasion
requires, the reins must not be allowed to slip
through the hands, but the arms should be
gradually advanced, without, however, inclining
the body forward.</p>

<p>The movements of the body must correspond
with those of the horse and of the rider's
hands; thus, when the animal is moving regularly
and straight forward, the hands, or bridle-hand,
being held firm and steady immediately
in front of the waist, the body must then be
seated squarely, with its front part to the front,
so that the rider can look directly between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
ears of her steed. When the animal turns completely
around to the right or to the left, the
shoulders and head of the rider must also turn
a little toward the direction taken by the horse,
while the hand must be slightly carried in an
opposite direction. When turning a corner, the
entire body from the hips upward must incline
toward the centre of the circle of which
the turn forms an arc, or, in other words, the
body must incline toward the direction taken
by the horse, and the degree of this inclination
must be proportioned to the bend of the horse's
body, and to the rapidity of his pace while
turning.</p>

<p>When the horse advances, and the hands
are relaxed, the body must momentarily lean
slightly forward without rounding the shoulders;
this will aid the horse in commencing
his forward movement. In stopping him, the
rider's body must be inclined slightly backward
as the hands rein him in. All these movements
should be made gradually, and never abruptly.</p>

<p>When a horse stumbles, or plunges from viciousness
or high spirits, the rider's body must
be inclined backward, as this will enable her to
maintain her balance more effectually as well
as to throw more weight upon the reins. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the contrary, when he rears the bridle-hand
must be instantly advanced or relaxed, the
body at the same time being inclined well forward,
which will throw the rider's weight upon
the animal's shoulders and fore-legs, and cause
him to lower his fore-feet to the ground.</p>

<p>A horse is said to be <b>united</b> or <b>collected</b>
when he moves easily in a regular, stylish manner,
well on his haunches, with head and neck
in proper position, his rider exercising perfect
control over him by gentle pressure upon his
mouth, and keeping up the regular movements
of the animal by a quiet and dexterous "give
and take" action of her hands.</p>

<p>He is <b>disunited</b> when he moves in an irregular
manner, or heavily upon his fore-legs, occasioning
the rider to support the weight of his
neck and shoulders; also, when the reins are
too slack and exercise no pressure upon his
mouth, in which case, having no aid or support
from his rider's hand, he will move carelessly,
or exactly as he pleases.</p>

<p>In <i>collecting a horse</i>, the aid of the whip
and the left leg will frequently be required,
as the rider's hand alone may not be sufficient.
In such a case, the left leg must be lightly
pressed against his left side and the whip at
the same time be pressed against his right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
side; these in conjunction with the action of the
bridle-hand,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> as heretofore explained, will collect
him and bring him up to his bridle with his
haunches well under him,&mdash;the proper position
for starting. As soon as he moves there should
be only a light pressure on his mouth. In
order to perform the above feat effectively, the
whip must not be too limber and must always
be held with its lash downward. This simultaneous
pressure of the whip and left leg has the
same effect in collecting the horse as that of
the horseman's right and left legs. Should the
horse flag in his movements or move heavily
upon his fore-legs, a repetition of this pressure
of the leg and whip, in conjunction with
the proper movements of the bridle-hand, will
bring him well on his haunches and lighten his
action.</p>

<p>The horse is always animated by mild taps of
the whip, light pressure of the hand upon the
curb, a clacking of the tongue, or an urging
tone of his mistress's voice. He is soothed and
rendered confident by mild and encouraging
tones of voice, by the rider's sitting easily, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a gentle hold upon the reins, and by caressing
pats upon his neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>In the directions given in this chapter, necessarily
involving more or less repetition, the
author has endeavored to be as clear, comprehensible,
and simple as possible. And the rider
will find it of much greater advantage to have
these instructions printed, than to be required
to learn them orally, as she can read and re-read
them at pleasure and have them thoroughly
committed to memory before mounting her
horse. And, although it has required many
pages to present these instructions to the reader,
she will find that their application will prove
very simple, and will also be agreeably surprised
to observe the great control she will have
over the feelings and movements of her steed
through their agency. Horses are generally
very sagacious, and appear to recognize promptly
any timidity, awkwardness, or ignorance on the
part of their riders, and, according to their temper
or disposition, will take advantage of such
recognition, either by advancing carelessly or
by manifesting trickiness or viciousness. The
best trained horse always requires to be kept
under command, but by kind treatment and
correct management. The horse, when ridden
by a finished horsewoman, knows that although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
allowed to move with a light rein he is under
the control of a masterly hand that will aid him
in his efforts to please, but will instantly bring
him into submission if he does not yield entire
obedience.</p>

<h3>THE WALK.</h3>

<p>In walking, the horse moves nearly simultaneously
the two legs that are diagonally opposite
to each other, first one pair, and then the other.
Thus, the right fore and the left hind leg make
one step nearly at the same time, and when
these have touched the ground, the left fore
and the right hind leg are raised and advanced
in a similar manner, and so on in succession.
In this manner as one pair of legs moves onward
the other pair sustains the weight of the
animal; and of the two legs that act together
the fore one is raised from as well as placed
upon the ground slightly previous to the hind
one. This is the reason why a horse which
walks well and in a regular manner will nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
or quite cover the foot-marks of his fore-feet
with those of his hind ones. If the hind-foot
should fall short of covering the track of the
fore one, the animal will not be a good walker;
if, on the contrary, it should pass somewhat beyond
the mark of the fore-foot, it will indicate
him to be a fast walker, although he may overreach.</p>

<p>In both the walk and the trot, when the horse
is moving regularly, a quick ear can detect four
distinct beats or tappings of the feet; when
these beats mark equal time and sound exactly
alike for each footstep, it may be inferred that
the horse is a good walker as well as a good
trotter, and that all his legs are sound. But if
one beat be lighter than the others, it may be
assumed that there is some disease in the foot
or leg that produces this beat. Horse-dealers
will often endeavor to disguise this defect by
adopting means to disable the animal temporarily
in his healthy leg, as the treads will then
be made more nearly alike, though the slight
shade of difference thus effected can be readily
detected by a quick, experienced ear. These
hoof-beats are best heard when made on a hard
road.</p>

<p>A horse that is a good walker will move with
a quick step, his hind-legs well under him, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
foot-taps marking regular time, and his feet
measuring exact distances, while he will lift his
feet just high enough to escape obstructions on
the road, thrusting each foot well forward, and
placing it lightly, though firmly and squarely,
upon the ground. He will advance in a straight
line, vacillating neither to the right nor left,
and should be able to accomplish at least from
four to four and a half miles per hour.</p>

<p>The walk of a lady's horse is almost always
neglected, and as a good walk is a sure foundation
for perfection in all other gaits, a lady
should positively insist that her steed be thoroughly
trained in this particular; especially if
she be large and majestic looking, because the
walk will then become her specialty. A stout
woman does not ride to the best advantage at
a rapid gait, but upon a horse that has the walk
in perfection she presents an imposing, queen-like
appearance. If her steed, however, be allowed
to saunter along in a careless, listless
manner, all the charm will be destroyed, and
the <i>tout ensemble</i> will present by no means a
pleasing picture.</p>

<p>The beginner in riding should learn to sit and
manage her horse in a walk, and should never
attempt to ride a faster gait until she can collect
her steed, make him advance, turn him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the right and to the left, and rein him back;
this last movement is a very important one,
with which few teachers strive to make their
pupils thoroughly acquainted. Reining back
will not only bring the horse under better command,
but, with a lady's horse, a short reining
back from time to time will improve his style
of motion in his various gaits; besides which,
the rider may on some occasion be placed in a
situation in which, for her own safety, she will
be compelled to move her horse backward.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_29"></a>
<img src="images/fig29.jpg" width="500" height="458" alt="Fig. 29.&mdash;The Walk." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 29.&mdash;The Walk.</p>
</div>

<p><b>To begin the walk</b>: The pupil, having
placed herself in the saddle, must not allow her
horse to move until she is quite prepared, her
skirt adjusted, and the whip and reins properly
arranged in her hands. Then, drawing gently
upon the curb and snaffle reins, a little more
upon the former than upon the latter, and at
the same time gently pressing against the animal's
side with her left leg, and against his right
side with the whip, as heretofore explained, she
will thus <i>collect her horse</i>, and start him upon
the walk. As soon as he has begun to move
forward, the pressure of the leg and whip must
cease, and the hand or hands must be held
steady on the snaffle, the curb no longer being
required, unless the animal flags in his movements.
The hold upon the snaffle must be only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
tense enough to enable the rider to feel the
beat of the horse's action as he places each foot
upon the ground, and to give him a slight support
and keep up an even action. Should this
support be too heavy, his step will be shortened,
and he will be unable to move freely; should
it be insufficient, he will carry his head low, will
not raise his feet high enough to escape stumbling,
will knock his toes against every inequality
of the ground, and both he and his rider
will present an indolent and listless aspect. Her
attitude should be easy and erect, but she should
yield herself slightly to the movements of the
horse although without showing any lack of
steadiness. (<a href="#Fig_29" class="inref">Fig. 29.</a>)</p>

<p>Should the horse be too much animated by
the reins and whip at the commencement of
the walk, he may enter upon a jog trot, or an
amble, in which case he must be checked by
gradually reining him in until he has settled
into a walk. Should he, on the contrary, not
be sufficiently animated, he will not exert himself
and will move in an irregular and indolent
manner; in this case, he must be made to raise
his head by a slight pull upon the curb-reins,
as already explained, and be again collected and
animated by the aid of the leg and whip.</p>

<p>A short, abrupt <b>turn in the walk</b> should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
never be made, if it can possibly be avoided;
it is only in case of emergency that it should
be attempted, and even then it is more or less
dangerous, because, as the horse moves his legs
diagonally in the walk, he may, when abruptly
turned, place one leg in the way of the other,
be thrown off his balance, and fall. When
turning a horse completely around, it should
always be done in a deliberate manner. This
rule should never be forgotten, especially by a
novice.</p>

<p>During her first lessons in the walk, the pupil,
in attempting to turn her horse to the right,
to the left, or completely around, must move
him very slowly, pressing her whip and left leg
against his sides, and keeping him well-balanced
by proper support upon <i>both</i> snaffle-reins. In
making a <b>turn to the right</b>, with a snaffle-rein
in each hand, the left hand must not abandon
the horse, but retain a steady pressure upon his
mouth, while the tension upon the right rein
must be increased by moving the right hand
and its little finger up and toward the body, at
the same time holding this hand a little lower
than the left one. The tension upon the right
rein should be nearly double that made upon
the left, and should be kept up until the turn
has been completed. In the turn to the right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the left leg should make a little stronger pressure
than that made by the whip, to prevent the
animal from throwing his croup too far to the
left; and in making the turn to the left, the
whip should press more strongly than the leg,
in order to prevent the croup from being carried
too far to the right.</p>

<p>In attempting <b>to turn</b> completely around <b>to
the left</b>, the same man&oelig;uvring, though in an
opposite direction, will be required; the above
directions for the two hands being simply reversed.</p>

<p>Should the horse fail to turn in a regular
manner, or refuse to obey the reins readily, he
must be collected, and brought up to the bridle
in the manner already described. This will
cause him to raise his head and place himself in
a position to move in the required manner, and
when this is done the rider must slacken the
tension upon the curb, and turn him with the
snaffle-rein.</p>

<p>In making these turns, care must be taken to
have ample space, and it must not be forgotten,
that while increasing the tension upon the rein
required to direct the turn, the other should not
be slackened or abandoned, but should continue
to give support to the horse, though in a less
degree; and also that this tension upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
reins is much more important when making a
partial or complete turn, than when the animal
is moving forward in a straight line. For, if
the reins be slackened, and the horse left to
himself, he will turn in an awkward manner,
may get one leg in the way of the other, and
perhaps stumble or fall, especially if the ground
be slippery, or rough and uneven.</p>

<p>It is a habit with many lady riders, as well as
with multitudes of horsemen, to make the turn
by carrying the bridle-hand in the direction of
the turn, thus pressing the outward rein, or the
one opposite to the direction of the turn, against
the horse's neck,&mdash;the inward rein being completely
slackened. This is a very dangerous
fault and one that instantly betrays ignorance
of correct horsemanship, because the animal is
thus left without any support at a time when
it is most needed. If a rider has any regard
for her own safety, she will remember this very
important rule, namely, <i>to support the horse on
both reins when making a turn</i>.</p>

<p>When all the reins are held in the bridle-hand
and a turn is to be made to the left, the fault is
sometimes committed of carrying the right hand
over to assist the left by pulling upon the left
rein; this is frequently done by ladies who
have not been properly instructed, and gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
them an awkward appearance. When riding
with the double bridle in the bridle-hand, if the
movements of the horse be controlled by this
hand and wrist, as explained in the preceding
chapter, the turn to the right or to the left
can be effected without abandoning the horse
by relaxing one of the reins, and also without
the assistance of the other hand. These man&oelig;uvres,
accomplished easily and gracefully,
indicate the well-instructed and correct bridle-hand,
the well-trained horse, and the accomplished
horsewoman, who will appear to manage
her steed more by mental influence than by any
perceptible movements of her hands.</p>

<p><b>To stop in the walk</b>, in a correct and regular
manner, is a sure criterion of a good horsewoman,
one that has her steed under complete
control, for this stop renders him more obedient,
and tends to collect him and to bring his
haunches into a pliant condition. To accomplish
this stop properly, the rider must brace
her arms firmly against her sides,&mdash;being careful
not to let her elbows protrude backward,&mdash;throw
her shoulders back, hold both reins
evenly and firmly, and tighten the tension upon
them by turning the hand and little fingers up
and carrying them toward the waist, at the
same time not omitting to press gently against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the horse's sides with the leg and whip. All
this should be accomplished by one simultaneous
movement, and the degree of tension made on
the reins should be in proportion to the sensitiveness
of the horse's mouth.</p>

<p>If the left leg and whip be not employed in
making the stop, the horse when brought to a
stand may throw his weight upon his shoulders
and fore-legs,&mdash;which he should never be
allowed to do, as it will destroy the pleasing
effect of the stop, and cause him to become disunited.
The animal should be so nicely balanced
upon his haunches when he stops, that, with a
little more liberty of rein, he can readily move
forward in a united and collected manner. The
reins must not be abruptly jerked, but be drawn
upon, as stated before, in a gradual and equal
manner. After the stop is completed, the reins
may be so far relaxed as to enable the horse to
again advance, should it be required. The stop
should always be made when the animal is advancing
straight forward, and never, if it can
possibly be avoided, when making a turn or going
around a corner.</p>

<p>If, when attempting to stop the horse, he
should <i>toss up his head</i>, the bridle-hand must
be kept low and firm, and the right hand be
pressed against his neck until his head is lowered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
when the rein-hold may be relaxed. In
such a case, the rider must be on her guard, as
a horse which stops in this manner may rear,
when she must immediately yield the reins.</p>

<p>The stop, especially in rapid gaits and when
effected suddenly, is very trying to the horse;
it should therefore be made only when necessary,
and never to display the rider's superior
command and excellent horsewomanship; many
horses, particularly those having weak loins,
have been caused much suffering and have had
their dispositions completely ruined by a too
frequent and injudicious practice of the stop.</p>

<p>In reining back or <b>backing in the walk</b>, the
horse bends his haunches and places one of his
hind-legs under his body, upon which to rest
and balance himself; this enables him to collect
force to impel his croup backward. To favor
this movement, the horse must be collected,
brought to stand square and even on his fore-legs,
and then be reined backward by a firm,
steady, and equal pull upon both the right and
left snaffle-reins.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The hands should be held
low and directly in front of the body, with the
knuckles down, and the little fingers turned up
and carried toward the body. During this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
whole movement care must be taken not to elevate
the hands. The body of the rider must
bend somewhat forward, with the waist drawn
in, but without any rounding of the shoulders,
while the leg and the whip must make gentle
pressure against the horse's sides, so as to
"bring him up to the bridle," and prevent his
deviating from the line in which it is desired to
back him. The backing must never be made
by one continuous pull; but as soon as the
movement is commenced, the hands and body of
the rider must yield so that the horse may regain
his balance, after which he may again be
urged backward. These actions should occur
alternately, so that with every step backward
the rider will yield her hands, and immediately
draw them back again, continuing these movements
until the horse has backed as far as desired.
If, instead of this course, a steady pull
be made, the horse may lose his balance and
fall, or may be compelled to rear.</p>

<p>When reining the horse back the body must
never be inclined backward, as is necessary
when stopping the horse; on the contrary, it
must always be inclined somewhat forward, as
this will enable the hands to manage the reins
more effectively, will give the horse more freedom
to recede, and, should he rear, will place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the rider in the proper balance. Should the
rider unfortunately incline her body backward,
and the horse rear, she would probably be unseated,
and should she pull upon the reins in
order to sustain herself and keep her seat, the
animal would be drawn backward, and probably
fall upon her.</p>

<p>In backing, the pull upon the reins must
never be made suddenly, but always gradually,
the hand rather soliciting than compelling.
When the reins are suddenly pulled upon, the
horse is very apt to get his hind-legs too far
forward under him, in which case it is impossible
for him to move backward.</p>

<p>In reining the horse directly backward, should
his croup move out of line to the right, the
pressure of the whip must be increased, or gentle
taps be given with it upon his right side
back of the saddle-flap, the hand at the same
time increasing the tension upon the right rein.
The taps of the whip must be very light, lest
the animal turn too much to the left.</p>

<p>Should the croup swerve to the left, the rider
must press her left leg against her horse's side,
or give light taps with her left heel upon his
side, turning the point of the toe out, moving
the leg a little back, and slightly separating the
knee from the side of the saddle, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
give these taps; at the same time she must increase
the tension upon the left rein until the
horse is brought into line.</p>

<p>When it is desired to rein back, but with an
inclination to the right, a slight extra bearing
or pull must be made upon the left rein, without
relaxing the steady tension upon the right
one. A pressure with the whip upon the right
side of the horse must at the same time be kept
up, in order that he may not carry his croup
too far to the right.</p>

<p>In reining back with an inclination to the left,
the pull upon the right rein must be slightly increased,
still keeping a steady feeling upon the
left one; then, by a constant pressure with the
left leg upon the horse's side, he will be prevented
from carrying his croup too far to the
left. Reining back teaches the horse to move
lightly, and improves the style of his different
gaits, but its effect is very severe upon him,
hence its practice should not be too frequent,
and always of short duration.</p>

<h3>THE TROT, THE AMBLE, THE PACE, THE RACK.</h3>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We ride and ride. High on the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fir-trees stretch into the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birches, which the deep calm stills,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quiver again as we speed by."<br /></span>
</div>

</div></div>


<p>In the trot, the horse moves his legs in the
same diagonal manner as in the walk, the only
difference being that in the trot they are moved
more rapidly. When trotting regularly and
evenly, the right fore-foot and the left hind-foot
strike the ground nearly simultaneously,
and then the left fore-foot and the right hind-foot
do the same; and so on alternately, two
legs being diagonally upon the ground at about
the same moment, while two legs are raised in
the air.</p>

<p>The strokes of the hoofs upon the ground are
called "beats," and are loud and quick, harmonizing
with the animal's rapidity of motion and
length of step. The trot is the safest gait for
a rider if the horse be free from any defect
in his limbs, as he will be less apt to stumble;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it is also less tiresome for the animal, because
while two legs are diagonally off the ground,
the other two support the weight of his body,
and thus one pair alternately and quickly relieves
the other.</p>

<p>There are three varieties of trot, namely, the
jog trot, the flying or racing trot, and the true
or even trot. In the <i>jog trot</i> each foot is placed
nearly in the same track it occupied before it
was raised, though somewhat in advance of it,
and it remains upon the ground a longer time
than when raised in the air, thus rendering the
gait almost as slow as the walk. If the horse
be young and spirited, he will prefer this gait
to that of the walk, and, if permitted, will naturally
adopt it. This should be guarded against,
and under no circumstances should he be allowed
to break into a jog trot; because, however
accomplished the rider may be, she will
find it a very unpleasant and excessively fatiguing
gait, and one which will make her look
very awkward. This variety of trot, however,
occasions less injury to the horse's feet and legs
than any other gait, and, on this account, it is
preferred by most farmers.</p>

<p>In the <i>racing</i> or <i>flying trot</i>, the horse is allowed
to step out without the least constraint,
the legs being extended as far as possible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
moving straight forward, while the animal spiritedly
enters into the occasion and gives out his
full power. In this trot all the legs are moved
very rapidly, and the hind ones with more force
than the fore-legs, in order that the horse's
body may, with each bound, be propelled as far
forward as possible. Between the two successive
bounds all four legs are momentarily off
the ground. Very springy fetlocks tend to diminish
speed in the flying trot, and hence, not
having such elastic fetlocks, a good trotting
racer is rough in his action and an undesirable
saddle-horse.</p>

<p>In the <i>true</i> or <i>even trot</i>, the action of the
horse is regular, all his limbs moving in an even
manner, his feet measuring exact distances, his
hoof-beats being in equal time of <i>one, two, three,
four</i>, and his feet, when moving rapidly, touching
the ground only for an instant. There are
two ways in which this trot may be ridden:
one is to sit closely to the saddle, moving as little
as possible, and making no effort to avoid
the roughness of the gait. This is the method
practiced by the cavalry of this country, as well
as by the armies in Europe, and is called the
"cavalry" or "French trot."</p>

<p>The other method is to relieve the joltings
by rising in the saddle in time with the horse's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
step. This is called the "English trot," and is
the favorite gait of the European and the American
civilian horsemen. It is only during the
last few years that this trot has been gradually
coming into favor with American horsewomen,
although the ladies of England, and of nearly
all continental Europe, have for a long time
ridden this gait as well as the canter and hand
gallop, having found that by alternating the
latter gaits with the trot they could ride greater
distances upon hard roads, and with much less
fatigue to themselves and their steeds. The
English trot does not wear out the horse so
quickly as the gallop and canter; indeed, it has
been generally found that the horse's trot improves
as he grows older, many horses having
become better trotters at their tenth or twelfth
year than at an earlier age. The trot in which
the hoof-beats are in time of only <i>one, two</i>, is
very difficult to ride.</p>

<p>In America, many persons condemn the English
trot for lady riders, which is hardly to be
wondered at when one observes the various
awkward and grotesque attitudes that are assumed,
even by many gentlemen, when attempting
to rise in the saddle. As for the
ladies who have undertaken this innovation,
their appearance on horseback, from want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
proper training or from lack of attention to
given rules, has, with but few exceptions, been
simply ridiculous. Even with correct teaching
and proper application, some ladies, although
they acquire the English trot, and do not make
caricatures of themselves while employing it,
yet do not appear to such advantage as when
in the canter or hand gallop. This is also the
case with European ladies, who differ very much
in their power to make this gait appear graceful.
A small, slightly built person, having a
short measurement from the hip to the knee,
can, when correctly taught, ride this trot with
much ease and grace. A tall woman will have
to lean too far forward with each rising movement
of her steed, as her length of limb will not
permit a short rise; she will therefore appear
to much less advantage in this gait; while a
stout built person will look rather heavy in the
rise from the saddle.</p>

<p>However, whether a lady is likely to present
an elegant appearance or not when riding the
English trot, she must, if she desires to become
an accomplished horsewoman, learn to ride this
particular gait, as it will enable her to gain a
correct seat, to keep a better and more perfect
balance, and to become more thorough in the
other gaits. From a hygienic point of view, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
will prove beneficial, and will preserve both
rider and horse from excessive fatigue when
traveling long distances. Under certain circumstances,
it will also enable a lady to ride a
man's horse, which will be very apt to have this
trot in perfection, and but little knowledge of,
or training in, any other gaits. In the country
a regular and sure trotting horse may often be
readily obtained, while it will be much more
difficult to procure one with a light, easy canter
or gallop. This trot, when well cadenced
and in perfect time, is very captivating, as the
rider escapes all jolting, and feels more as if she
were flying through the air than riding upon a
horse.</p>

<p>There is, however, one objection to the English
trot to which attention should be directed;
namely, if the lady ride on a two-pommeled
saddle, and the horse happens to shy, or to turn
around suddenly, while she is in the act of rising,
she is very likely to be unseated or thrown
from her horse. With the three-pommeled
saddle, however, this accident will be much less
liable to occur, but the lady should always be
on her guard when riding this trot, especially
if her steed be nervous; and to avoid an accident
of the kind just named, she should keep
her left knee directly under the third pommel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
but without pressing up against it enough to
interfere with the rising motion, or just so close,
that in pressing upon the stirrup and straightening
her knee she can rise about four inches
from the saddle; the distance between the upper
surface of the knee and the under surface
of the pommel will then be about one and a
half, or two inches. If, in the rise, she does
not find herself embarrassed by the third pommel,
she may know that the stirrup-leather is
of the correct length for this trot. The more
rapid and regular the trot, the easier and shorter
will be the rise, and the less noticeable the
movements of the rider, because, when trotting
fast, the rise will be effected with but very little
effort on her part, and will be almost entirely
due to the rapid action of the horse. To rise
when trotting slowly, will be neither easy nor
pleasant for the rider, and in this gait she will
not appear to much advantage.</p>

<p>In the <b>French</b> or <b>cavalry trot</b>, the body
should be inclined a little backward, being kept
as firm as possible but without stiffness, while
at the same time the rider should sit as closely
to the saddle as she can, with the left knee directly
under the third pommel, not using force
to press up against it, but simply holding it
there to sustain the limb and to assist in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
it as firm and steady as possible during the
roughness of this gait&mdash;while the reins should
be held a little firmer than for the walk. This
trot should never be ridden by ladies after their
first lessons in riding, unless the horse moves so
easily in it that his rider is not jolted in the
least. To trot so softly that no shock will be
experienced by the rider as the horse's feet
touch the ground will require a thorough-bred
of rare formation.</p>

<p>Before the invention of the three-pommeled
saddle the French trot was always employed in
the best riding-schools, a beginner being required
to practice it for a long time, in order to acquire
the proper firmness in the saddle; but
since the invention of the third pommel the
cavalry trot has been almost entirely dispensed
with, as this pommel at once gives a firmness of
seat that could be obtained on an old-fashioned
two-pommeled saddle only after taking many
fatiguing lessons in the French trot. It was
this fatigue that caused so many persons to condemn
horseback riding for ladies, and it also
proved a cause of discouragement to the pupils
in the riding-school, frequently giving rise to
a decided dislike for horseback exercise. But
since the employment of the third pommel, it
is only necessary for the pupil to take two or
three lessons in the French trot, just enough to
enable her to understand the movement, after
which she may proceed to rise in the English
style. However, a knowledge of the cavalry
trot will be found useful, as a horse, when
reined in from a gallop or canter, will often
trot a short distance before stopping; and if
the rider understands this trot, she will be able
to sit close to the saddle, and not appear awkward
by jolting helplessly about.</p>

</div>

<p>Of all the styles of riding, there is none so
difficult to describe or to learn as the <b>English
trot</b>. We will make an effort, however, to render
it comprehensible to the reader. Considerable
study and practice will be required to learn
it perfectly, but when once learned it will indicate
the thoroughly accomplished horsewoman.
(<a href="#Fig_30" class="inref">Fig. 30.</a>)</p>

<p>To commence the English trot, the rider must
collect her horse, as for the walk, and then, as
he advances, keep a firm, even tension upon the
<i>snaffle-reins</i>, because, in this trot, the animal
will rely wholly upon his rider to support him
and hold him to the pace, without the "give
and take" movements of the hands required in
the other gaits. It is not meant by this that a
dead pull is to be made, but that the support
must be firm and steady, with a proper correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a><br /><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
between the bridle-hand and the
horse's mouth. The elbows must be held steady
and lightly near the rider's sides, but not close
against them. As the horse extends his trot,
an unpleasant roughness or jolting will be experienced,
which will give an upward impetus
to the rider's body; the moment she is conscious
of this impetus, she must allow herself to
be raised from her horse in regular time with
his step or hoof-beats. In this trot, the horse
will always have a leading foot, either the right
or left, and the foot he leads with is the one to
which the rider must rise,&mdash;rising when the
leading foot is lifted, and touching the saddle
when this foot touches the ground. Most riders
do this instinctively, as it were, rising and falling
with the leading foot.</p>

<p>In <i>this rise</i> the action of the horse alone will
give the impetus; no effort must be made by
the lady, <i>except</i> to press slightly, or rather to
sustain herself gently upon the stirrup, and
keep her knee and instep yielding and flexible
with the rise. Care must be taken not to allow
the leg to swing forward and backward. The
rise should be made as straight upward as possible,
the upper part of the body inclining forward
no more than is necessary to effect the
rise with ease. The back must be kept well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
curved, and the shoulders square to the front of
the horse, without lifting them up, or rounding
them in rising.</p>

<p>The <b>leading foot of the horse</b> is that fore-foot
or leg with which he commences his advance
in the gait; it will always be carried
somewhat beyond its fellow, while, at the same
time, that side of the animal's body which corresponds
with the leading foot will be a little
more advanced toward this foot, though almost
imperceptibly so. Every rider should be taught
to know with which foot her horse leads.</p>

<p>When a horse trots evenly and quickly, and
with rather a short step, the rise in the saddle
will be barely perceptible; but when he trots
slowly and with a long step, the rise will have
to be higher, in order that the rider may keep
time with the slowness and length of his step.
In this gait a tall woman will be very apt to
prefer a long step to a short one.</p>

<p>In making the rise, the rider must never assist
herself by pulling upon the reins, which
should be held firm and low to give support <i>to
the horse alone</i>, not allowing them to slip in the
least from between the thumb and forefinger
that should hold them steady.</p>

<p><i>The descent</i> of the body to the saddle must
be effected as gently as possible. The right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
knee should be pressed against the second pommel,
and the left foot lean lightly upon the stirrup,
the left foot and instep being kept yielding
and flexible with the descent, and the body and
right leg bearing<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> a little to the right. The
descent should be made just in time to catch
the next impetus of the horse's movement, so
that the saddle will be hardly touched before
the rider's body will again be thrown upward to
make the rise.</p>

<p>It presents a very comical and inelegant appearance
for a rider, whether man or woman,
when attempting the rising trot, to elevate and
protrude the shoulders, curve the back out so
as to round it, lean forward toward the horse's
ears, with elbows sticking out from the rider's
sides and flopping like the wings of a restless
bird, while the body is bobbing up and down
like a dancing-jack, out of all time with the
movements of the animal. One reason why
some persons are so awkward in the rise is that
they sit too far back upon the saddle. This
obliges them to sustain themselves upon the
stirrup obliquely, thus causing them to lean too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
far forward in order to accomplish the rise more
easily. Another cause of awkwardness in the
rising trot is an improperly constructed saddle.
The seat or platform should be as nearly
level as a properly made saddle will permit.
When the front part or arch is much higher
than the seat, it will be difficult to use the
second pommel as a point of support for the
right knee, which support is highly essential
during the descent, in this trot. It is a common
thing to see riders exaggerate the rise by
pressing hard upon the stirrup and supporting
themselves by the reins, thus rising higher
than necessary, and coming down with a heavy
thump upon the saddle; to which equestrian
gymnastics they give the name of "English
trot."</p>

<p>When rising and descending in the English
trot, the left leg, from knee to instep, must
be held perpendicular and steady; the foot,
from toe to heel, must rest horizontally in the
stirrup, and in a line with the horse's side. The
foot should not be allowed to turn out, nor the
leg to swing backward and forward: if the foot
be pointed out, this will tend to carry the body
and leg too much toward the left, on the rise;
and, if the leg be allowed to swing, it will cause
the rider to lose the rhythm of the trot. Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the stirrup must not be too strongly pressed
upon, as this will throw all the rider's weight
upon the left side, and may cause the saddle to
turn. On making the rise, great care must be
taken not to advance the left shoulder, nor to
turn the body to the left; many riders do these
things with the idea that they will enable them
to rise with more ease. But this is an error, for
such movements will not only occasion fatigue,
but will also render the rein-hold unsteady, and
the action of the foot and knee uncertain. The
body and shoulders must always be square to
the front when the horse is trotting straight
forward, the body remaining as erect as the
action of the horse will allow.</p>

<p><b>To stop</b> a well-trained horse <b>in this gait</b>, it
will simply be necessary for the rider to cease
rising, sit down to the saddle, and gradually
loosen the reins. Many horses, however, are
trained to make the stop in the usual way, by
having the reins tightened. The advance and
the turns are to be conducted in the same manner
as that described for the walk.</p>

<p>In the English trot, the horse must be kept
well up to his gait; should he appear to move
heavily or disunitedly the reins must be gradually
shortened, and the animal be collected.
Should he step short, in a constrained manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the reins must be gradually lengthened, to give
him more freedom. If he break into a gallop
when it is desired that he should trot, he must
be gradually reined in to a walk, and then be
started again upon a trot, and this course must
be repeated until he obeys, stopping him every
time he attempts to gallop, and then starting
the trot anew. If he trot too rapidly, he must
be checked, by bracing the bridle-hand and
increasing the pull upon the reins. If the trot
be too slow, the hand must relax the reins a little,
and the horse be animated by the voice, and
by gentle taps with the whip. To regulate the
trot, to keep it smooth and harmonious, to rein
in the horse gently without rendering him unsteady,
and then gradually to yield the hand so
that he may move forward again in a regular
manner, are very difficult points for beginners
to accomplish while still keeping up the proper
support upon the bit, and will require study and
considerable practice.</p>

<p>A horse should never be urged into a more
rapid trot than he can execute in an even, regular
manner; if compelled to exceed this, he
will break into a rough gallop, or into such an
irregular trot as will render it impossible for the
rider to time the rise.</p>

<p>An accomplished horsewoman, when trotting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
her horse, will make no observable effort, and
there will be perfect harmony between her
steed and herself. When the English trot is
ridden in this manner, the person who can condemn
it must, indeed, be extremely fastidious.
However, it must be acknowledged that it will
require the lithe, charming figure of a young
lady to exhibit its best points, and to execute
it in its most pleasing and graceful style. The
very tall, the inactive, or the stout lady may
ride this gait with ease to herself and horse,
and when properly taught will not render herself
awkward or ridiculous, but she can never
ride it with the willowy grace of the slender
woman of medium size.</p>

<p><b>Trotting in a circle</b> may be practiced in a
riding-school, or upon a level, open space or
ground, having a circular track about seventy-five
or eighty feet in diameter. It is very excellent
practice, especially in teaching the rider
to rise in unison with the horse's trot, whether
he leads with the right or left leg. For first
lessons, the pupil must commence by circling to
the right, as this is the easiest to learn, and will
teach her to bear toward the right side of the
horse. It is very essential that in first lessons
she should do this; because in the English trot
she will have to guard carefully against inclining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to the left in the rise and descent, a fault
common to all beginners who are not better instructed.</p>

<p>In circling, the horse will always incline toward
the centre of the circle, with which inclination
the rider's body must correspond, by
leaning in the same direction; if this precaution
should be neglected and the horse be trotting
rapidly, the rider will lose her balance, and fall
off on the side opposite to that of the inclination.
The distance she should lean to the right
or to the left must be in proportion to the size of
the circle that is being passed over, and also to
the inward bearing of the horse's body. Should
the circle be small and the gait rapid, the inclination
of the rider's body will have to be
considerable to enable her to maintain her seat
and keep in unison with the horse. If the circle
be large, say eighty feet in diameter, the inclination
will be slight.</p>

<p>In order to <i>circle to the right</i>, when holding a
curb and a snaffle rein in each hand, the pupil
must collect her horse by the aid of curb, leg,
and whip, as already explained, and start him
forward on the snaffle, holding the right rein
a little lower than the left, and drawing it
enough to enable her to see plainly the corner
of his right eye; the reins must be held steadily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
no sudden jerks being given to them, as
these will cause the horse to move irregularly
and swerve about. Should his croup be turned
too much to the right, the pressure of the whip
will bring it to the left; if it be turned too much
to the left, the pressure of the left leg will bring
it to the right.</p>

<p>In <i>circling to the left</i>, the horse will incline
his body to the left, toward the centre of the
circle. It is not very easy to learn to circle to
the left, but when once learned, it will be found
no more difficult than circling to the right, provided
the animal has been properly trained and
made supple, so as to lead with either leg.
Horses that have been trained to lead with the
right leg only will, when required to change
and lead with the left, move in a confined, inflexible,
and irregular manner, so that it will be
impossible to time the rise from the saddle. In
riding in the circle to the left, the directions for
circling to the right must be reversed, the rider
leaning to the <i>left</i>, pulling the <i>left</i> rein a little
tighter, etc. Great care must be taken, however,
not to lean too much toward the left in
making the rise. The degree of inclination
should not in this case be so great as the corresponding
inclination when circling to the right,
for if it is the rider will throw her weight too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
much upon the stirrup side, and may cause the
saddle to turn.</p>

<p>In practicing riding in a circle, it will be
found very advantageous to vary the size of the
circle, first riding in a large one, then gradually
contracting it, and again enlarging it; or
the rider, while practicing upon a large circle,
may make a cross-cut toward the centre of this
circle, so as to enter upon another one of smaller
diameter, and, after riding for a short time in the
smaller circle, she may again pass out to resume
her ride upon the larger one. These changes
from large to narrow circles form excellent
practice for pupils, but should always, if possible,
be performed under competent instruction.</p>

<p>The first lessons in trotting in a circle should
always be of short duration, and the pupil required
to ride slowly, the speed being gradually
increased as she gains knowledge and confidence.
The moment she experiences fatigue
she should dismount, and rest, before resuming
the lesson.</p>

<p><b>In the amble</b> the horse's movements very
strongly resemble those of the camel, two legs
on one side moving together alternately with
the two legs of the other side. Thus one side
of the animal supports the weight of his body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
while the other side moves forward, and so on
in alternation. This is an artificial gait, and
one to which the horse must usually be trained;
though some horses whose ancestors have been
forced to travel in this gait, have themselves
been known to amble without any training. In
the feudal ages it was the favorite pace for a
lady's palfrey, but at the present day it is no
longer countenanced by good taste.</p>

<p><b>The pace</b>, however, which is so well liked by
many ladies in this country, is a kind of amble,
although the steps taken are longer. A good
pacer can frequently travel faster than most
horses can in the trot. When the steed moves
easily and willingly, the pace is very pleasant
for short rides, but for long journeys, unless the
animal can change his gait to a hand gallop or
a canter, it will become very unpleasant and
tiresome. Many pacers are almost as rough in
their movements as the ordinary trotter; and
although they do not jolt the rider up and down
upon the saddle, yet they jerk her body in such
a manner as successively and alternately to
throw one side forward and the other slightly
back with each and every step, rendering a
ride for any distance very fatiguing.</p>

<p><b>The rack</b>, at one time so much liked, has become
almost obsolete. This is a peculiar gait,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
not easily described, in which the horse appears
to trot with one pair of legs and amble with the
other, the gait being so mixed up between an
amble and a defective trot as to render it almost
a nondescript. When racking, the horse will
appear constrained and uncomfortable, and will
strongly bear upon the rider's hand; some animals
so much so, as completely to weary the
bridle-hand and arm in a ride of only an hour
or two. This constant bearing of the horse's
head upon the reins soon renders him hard
mouthed, and, consequently, not easily and
promptly managed. The rack soon wears out
a horse, besides spoiling him for other gaits,
and so injures his feet and legs that a racker
will rarely be suitable for the saddle after his
eighth year. It is an acquired step, much disliked
by the horse, which has always to be
forced into it by being urged forward against
the restraint of a curb-bit; and he will, whenever
an opportunity presents, break into a rough
trot or canter, so that the rider has to be constantly
on the watch, and compel him to keep
in the rack against his will. And although the
motion does not jolt much, the aspect of the
horse and rider is not as easy and graceful as in
the canter and hand gallop, there being an appearance
of unwillingness and restraint that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
by no means pleasing. The directions for the
French trot will answer for both the pace and
the rack, except that in the latter the traction
upon the reins must be greater.</p>

<p>In the gallop, the horse always has a leading
foot or leg. In <i>leading with the right fore-foot</i>,
he will raise the left one from the ground, and
then the right will immediately follow, but will
be advanced somewhat beyond the left one;
and this is the reason why, in this case, the
right side is called the "leading side." In the
descent of the fore-feet, the left one will touch
the ground first, making the first beat, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
be immediately followed by the leading or
right fore-foot which will make the second beat.
The hind-legs are moved in a similar way, the
left hind-foot making the third beat, and the
right one the fourth. These beats vary in accordance
with the adjustment of the horse's
weight, but when he gallops true and regular,
as in the canter, the hoof-beats distinctly mark
<i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, <i>four</i>. In the rapid gallop the
hoof-beats sound in the time of <i>one-two</i>, or <i>one-two-three</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>leading with the left foot</i>, the left side of
the horse will be advanced slightly and the left
leg be carried somewhat beyond the right, the
action being just the reverse of that above described
when leading with the right leg. In
this case the left side is termed the "leading
side." The hoof-beats of horses in the trot
and gallop have been admirably rendered by
Bellini, in the opera of "Somnambula," just
previous to the entrance of Rudolfo upon the
stage. There are three kinds of gallop, namely,
the <i>rapid</i> or <i>racing</i>, the <i>hand gallop</i>, and the
<i>canter</i>.</p>

<p><b>The canter</b> is a slow form of galloping, which
the horse performs by throwing his weight
chiefly upon his hind-legs, the fore ones being
used more as supports than as propellers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Horses will be found to vary in their modes of
cantering, so much so as to render it almost
impossible to describe them accurately. Small
horses and ponies have a way of cantering with
a loose rein, and without throwing much weight
upon their haunches, moving their feet rapidly,
and giving pattering hoof-beats. Most ponies
on the Western prairies canter in this manner,
and it is said to be a very easy gait for a horseman
though very unpleasant, from its joltings,
for a lady.</p>

<p>Another canter is what might be termed the
"canter of a livery-stable horse." This appears
to be partly a run and partly a canter, a peculiarity
which is due to the fact that one or more
of the animal's feet are unsound, and he adopts
this singular movement for the purpose of obtaining
relief. The little street gamins in London
recognize the sound of this canter at once,
and will yell out, in time with the horse's hoof-beats,
"three pence, two pence," in sarcastic
derision of the lady's hired horse and the unhappy
condition of his feet.</p>

<p>In the true canter, which alone is suitable for
a lady, the carriage of the horse is grand and
elegant. In this gait, the animal has his hind-legs
well under his body, all his limbs move
regularly, his neck has a graceful curve, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
responds to the slightest touch of the rider's
hand upon the reins. A horse that moves in
this manner is one for display; his grand action
will emphasize the grace of a finished rider, and
the appearance of the <i>tout ensemble</i> will be the
extreme of elegance and well-bred ease.</p>

<p>Horses intended for ladies' use are generally
trained to lead in the canter with the right or
off fore-foot. Most lady riders, whose lessons
in riding have been limited, sit crosswise upon
their saddles. This position, without their being
aware of it, places them more in unison
with the horse's movements, and thereby renders
the canter with this lead the easiest gait
for them. But if a horse be constantly required
to canter with this lead he will soon become
unsound in his left hind-leg, because in
leading with the right fore-foot he throws the
greater part of his weight upon his left hind-leg,
and thus makes it perform double duty.
For this reason the majority of ladies' horses,
when the canter is their principal gait, will be
found to suffer from strained muscles, tendons,
and articulations.</p>

<p>A finished rider will from time to time relieve
her horse by changing the lead to the left
leg, or else she will change the canter to a trot.
Should her horse decidedly refuse to lead with
the foot required, whether right or left, it may
be inferred that he is unsound in that leg or
foot; in which case he should be favored, and
permitted to make his own lead, while the canter
should frequently be changed to a walk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_31"></a>
<img src="images/fig31.jpg" width="500" height="353" alt="Fig. 31.&mdash;Entering upon the Canter with the Right Leg leading." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 31.&mdash;Entering upon the Canter with the Right Leg leading.</p>
</div>

<p>To <b>commence the canter</b>, the horse must be
brought to a walk, or to a stand, then be placed
on his haunches, and collected by means of the
curb, left leg, and whip; and then the bridle-hand
must be raised, while the second, third,
and fourth fingers are moved to and fro, so as
to give gentle pulls upon the curb-reins, thus
soliciting the animal to raise his fore-feet. In
performing these man&oelig;uvres, the rider must be
careful to direct the leg with which she desires
her horse to lead. This may be done as follows:
If she desires to have the <b>right leg
lead</b>, the tension upon the left curb-rein must,
<i>just before</i> the animal rises to take his first step,
be increased enough to make him incline his
head so far to the left that the rider can see his
left nostril, while, simultaneously, her left leg
must press against his side. By these means,
the horse will be prompted to place himself
obliquely, with his head rather to the left, and
his croup to the right.</p>

<p>The rider, if seated exactly in the centre of
her saddle, must take a position corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a><br /><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to that of the horse, by throwing her right hip
and shoulder somewhat forward, her face looking
toward the animal's head, while her body
is held erect with the shoulders gracefully inclined
backward, and the hollow of the back
well curved inward. Any stiffness or rigidity
of the body must be guarded against in these
movements and positions. The rider must hold
herself in a pliant manner, and yield to the motions
of the horse. The left leg must be held
steady, the knee being placed directly underneath
the third pommel, and care must be taken
not to press upon the stirrup, as this will tend
to raise the body from the saddle, and convey
its weight almost wholly to the left side.</p>

<p>The hands must be held somewhat elevated
and steady, and, as the horse advances, the tension
on the reins must be even, so that the fingers
can feel every cadence of his step, and give
and take with his movements. Unlike the trot,
in which the horse must be supported by the
snaffle, the canter will require the curb to sustain
and keep up his action. After the animal
has started in the canter with the right leg
leading, should he incline too much to the left,
the tension upon the right rein must be increased,
so as to turn his head more to the
right and bring him to the proper inclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
for the lead of the right leg. This correction
must be effected gradually and lightly, so as
not to disturb the gait, or cause him to change
his leading leg. This canter with the right leg
leading is very easy to learn, and will not require
much practice to master.</p>

<p>However, should the horse fail to obey these
indications of the left rein and leg, and start off
in a false and disunited manner, as explained
under "the turn in the canter," another course
should be pursued, namely: the tension upon
the right or off curb-rein must be increased so
as to bring the animal's nose to the right, as if
he were going to turn to the right on a curve,
while at the same time the left leg must be
pressed against his side in order to have him
carry his croup slightly to the right. Now he
must be made to lift his fore-feet by increased
tension on both curb reins, and then be urged
forward. As he advances, the hands should be
extended a little to give him more freedom in
the spring forward, and he will then naturally
lead with the right side advanced. When once
started in this gait, the rider must equalize the
tension upon the reins, having placed herself in
the saddle, in the manner explained for the canter.
To have him lead with the left leg, a similar
but reversed course must be pursued, using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
pressure with the whip, instead of the leg, to
make him place his croup to the left.</p>

<p>To canter with the <b>left leg leading</b> will be
found more difficult to acquire, and will demand
more study and practice. The horse, having
been collected, must then be inclined obliquely
to the right. To accomplish this, the rider
must increase the tension of the right curb-rein,
and press her whip against the animal's right
side, which will urge his head to the right and
his croup to the left. In order that the position
of the rider's body may correspond with that of
the horse, her left hip and shoulder must be
slightly advanced, in precedence of her right
hip and shoulder. It will be observed that the
man&oelig;uvring in this lead is similar to that in
which the right leg leads, except that the <i>direction</i>
of the positions, of the management of the
reins, and of the horse's bearing during the canter
is simply reversed; in either lead, however,
the tension or bearing upon the reins, as the
horse advances in the canter, must be equal.</p>

<p>It may be proper to state here that, as the
amount of tension needed upon the reins when
cantering varies considerably with different
horses, some needing only the lightest touch,
the rider will, consequently, have to ascertain
for herself how much will be suitable for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
horse. Some horses, after having fairly started
in the canter, will bend their necks so as to
carry their chin closer to the throat, while
others again will extend the neck so as to carry
the chin forward. In the first instance, the
reins will have to be shortened in order to give
the animal the proper support in the gait, as
well as to keep up the correspondence between
his mouth and the bridle-hand; in the latter
they will require to be lengthened, to give him
more freedom in his movement. Should the
reins be held too short, or the rider's hand be
heavy and unyielding, the horse will be confined
in his canter; should the reins be held too
long, he will canter carelessly, and will either
move heavily upon his fore-legs, or break into
an irregular trot.</p>

<p>A rider may by attending to the following directions
readily determine whether her horse
be leading with the leg she desires, and also
whether he be advancing in a true and united
manner: If he be moving regularly and easily,
with a light play upon the reins in harmony
with the give and take movements of the hand,
his head being slightly inclined in a direction
opposite to that of the leading leg, and his action
being smooth and pleasant to the rider, he
will, as a rule, be cantering correctly. But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
he be moving roughly and unevenly, giving
the rider a sensation of jolting, if his head is
inclined toward the same side as that of the
leading leg, and he does not yield prompt obedience
to the reins, then he is not cantering
properly, and should be immediately stopped,
again collected, and started anew. If necessary
this course should be repeated until he advances
regularly and unitedly.</p>

<p>Some horses, after having fairly entered upon
the canter, will change the leading leg, and will
even keep changing from one to the other, at
short intervals. This is a bad habit, and one
that will never be attempted by a well-trained
animal, unless his rider does not understand
how to support him correctly and to keep him
leading with the required leg. A horse should
never be allowed to change his leading leg except
at the will of his rider; and should he do
so, he should be chidden and stopped instantly,
and then started anew.</p>

<p>If the rider when trotting rapidly wishes to
change to a canter, she must first moderate
the trot to a walk, because the horse will otherwise
be apt to break from the trot into a rapid
gallop. Should he insist upon trotting, when it
is desired that he should canter, he must be
stopped, collected with the curb-bit, as heretofore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
described in the directions for commencing
the canter, and started anew. This course must
be repeated every time he disobeys, and be continued
until he is made to canter.</p>

<p>It may be remarked here that, in the canter,
whenever the horse moves irregularly, advances
heavily upon his fore-legs, thus endeavoring to
force his rider's hand, or when he fails to yield
ready obedience, he should always be stopped,
collected, and started anew,&mdash;repeating this
course, if necessary, several times in succession.
Should the animal, however, persist in his disobedience,
pull upon the reins, and get his head
down, his rider must, as he moves on, gently
yield the bridle-reins, and each time he pulls
upon them she must gradually, but firmly, increase
the tension upon them, by drawing them
in toward her waist. This counter-traction
must be continued until the horse yields to the
bridle and canters properly. When he pulls
upon the reins his rider in advancing her hands
to yield the reins should be careful to keep her
body erect, and not allow it to be pulled forward.</p>

<p><b>The turn in the canter.</b> In turning to <i>the
right</i>, if the horse is leading with the inward
leg, or the one toward the centre of the circle
of which the distance to be turned forms an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
arc, in the present instance the right fore-leg
which is followed by the right hind-leg, he is
said to be true and united, and will be able to
make the turn safely. Should the turn be made
toward <i>the left</i>, the horse leading with his inward
or left fore-leg, followed by the left hind-leg,
he will likewise be true and united.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the animal will be disunited
when, in cantering to the right, he leads with
the right fore-leg followed by the left hind-leg,
or when he leads with the left fore-leg followed
by the right hind-leg. In either case, from want
of equilibrium in action and motion, a very
slight obstruction may make him fall.</p>

<p>In turning toward the left, in a canter, the
horse will be disunited if he leads with the left
fore-leg followed by the right hind-leg, or if he
leads with the right fore-leg followed by the
left hind-leg, as in the preceding instance, he
will be liable to fall. A horse is said to go false
when, in turning to the right, in the canter, he
leads with both left legs, or advances his left
side beyond his right; also, when in cantering
to the left he leads with both right legs or advances
his right side beyond his left; in either
of these false movements he will be very liable
to fall.</p>

<p>When it is desired to <b>turn to the right</b>, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the canter, the horse must be kept well up to
the bridle, so as to place his haunches forward
and well under him, thus keeping him light on
his fore-legs, and preventing his bearing too
heavily upon his shoulders; and, while the inward
rein is being tightened in order to make
the turn, the outward one must continue to
support the horse, being just loose enough to
allow him to incline his head and neck toward
the inner side of the turn. Pressure from the
left leg of the rider will keep the animal from
inclining his haunches too much to the left, during
the turn. Should the steed be turned
merely by means of the inward rein, without
being kept well up to the bridle, and without
either leg or whip being used upon his outer
side, he will turn heavily upon his forehand,
and will be obliged to change to the outward
leg in order to support himself. This will cause
him, after the turn has been accomplished, to
advance in a disunited way in the canter.</p>

<p>When it is desired to <b>turn to the left</b>, the instructions
in the preceding paragraph may be
pursued, the directions, however, being reversed
and pressure with the whip being employed instead
of that with the leg.</p>

<p>Sudden, sharp turns, are always dangerous,
however sure-footed the horse may be, and especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
care should be taken not to turn quickly
to the right when the left fore-leg leads, nor to
the left when the right fore-leg leads, as in
either case the animal will almost certainly be
thrown off his balance. In turning a "sharp
corner," especially when the rider cannot see
what she is liable to encounter, it will be better
for her to make the turn at a walk, and
keep her own side of the road, the right.</p>

<p><b>The stop in the canter.</b> In bringing the
horse to a stand, in the canter, he should be
well placed on his haunches by gradually increasing
the pull upon the curb-reins just as his
fore-feet are descending toward the ground;
the hind-feet being then well under the horse
will complete the stop. The rider must guard
against leaning forward, as this will not only
prevent the horse from executing the stop in
proper form, but should he suddenly come to a
stand, it will throw her still farther forward,
and the reins will become relaxed. Now, while
she is thus leaning forward, should the animal
suddenly raise his head, the two heads will be
very likely to come into unpleasant contact; or
should the horse stumble, his liability to fall will
be increased, because the rider will not be in a
proper position to support him, and will increase
the weight upon his shoulders, by being so far
forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Many ladies not only lean forward while
effecting the stop, but also draw the bridle-hand
to the left, and carry the bridle-arm back so
that the elbow projects behind and beyond the
body, while at the same time they elevate the
shoulder on this side. This is an extremely
awkward manner of bringing a horse to a stand.
The stop should be made in the same manner
as that described in the walk, that is, by gradually
drawing the bridle-hand toward the waist,
etc.</p>

<p>Nearly all horses, unless exceptionally well
trained, will trot a short distance before coming
to a stand in the canter or gallop, and it is here
that a knowledge of the French or cavalry trot
will prove essential, because the rider will then
comprehend the motion, and will sit closely to
the saddle until the horse stops. In all cases,
the horse should be brought to a stand in a regular,
collected manner, so that with a little
more liberty of rein he can promptly reënter
upon the canter, should this be desired.</p>

<p>The hand gallop is an intermediate gait between
the canter and the flying gallop. Its
motion, though rather rapid, is smooth, easy,
and very agreeable for both rider and steed.
Nearly all horses, especially spirited ones, prefer
this movement to any other; the bronchos on
the plains of the far West will keep up this
long, easy lope or hand gallop for miles, without
changing their gait, or requiring their riders to
draw rein, and without any apparent fatigue.
This pace is likewise a favorite one with riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
parties, as the motion is so smooth that conversation
can be kept up without difficulty. If
the animal's movements are light, supple, and
elegant, the lady rider presents a very graceful
appearance when riding this gait, as the reactions
in it are very mild; it is the gait <i>par excellence</i>,
for a country ride.</p>

<p>On a breezy summer morning, there is nothing
more exhilarating than a ride at a hand
gallop, on a willing, spirited horse; it brightens
the spirits, braces the nerves, refreshes the
brain, and enables one to realize that "life is
worth living."</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I tell thee, O stranger, that unto me<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The plunge of a fiery steed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a noble thought,&mdash;to the brave and free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is music, and breath, and majesty,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">'Tis the life of a noble deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart and the mind are in spirit allied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the charm of a morning's glorious ride."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Let all gloomy, dyspeptic invalids try the
cheering effects of a hand gallop, that they may
catch a glimpse of the sunlight that is always
behind even the darkest cloud of despondency.</p>

<p>When the horse is advancing in a collected
canter, if the rider will animate him a little
more by gentle taps with the whip, and then as
he springs forward give him more liberty of
the curb-rein, he will enter upon a <b>hand gallop</b>.
In this gait he will lead either with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
left or the right foot, but the oblique position
of his body will be very slight. The management
of the reins, the turns to the right or to
the left, the stop, and the position of the rider's
body, must, in this gait be the same as in the
canter, except that the body need not be quite
so erect, and the touch upon the reins must be
very light, barely appreciable.</p>

<p>If riding a spirited horse, the lady must be
upon her guard, lest he increase his speed and
enter into a flying or racing gallop. Any horse
is liable to do this when he has not been properly
exercised, especially if he is with other
horses, when a spirit of rivalry is aroused, and he
sometimes becomes almost unmanageable from
excitement. Many livery-stable horses, although
quiet enough in the city, will, when ridden
upon country roads, especially in the spring, require
all the skill of their riders to keep them
under control. The change from the stone and
brick of the city or town to the odor of the
fresh grass and the sight of green fields has an
exhilarating effect upon them, and makes them
almost delirious with gladness, so that they act
like anything but sensible, quiet, well-worked
horses.</p>

<p>When her horse manifests any such disposition,
the rider must retain her presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
mind, and not permit any nervousness or excitement
on her part to increase that of her
horse. She must keep him well under the control
of the curb-bit, and not allow him to increase
his speed; when he endeavors to do so,
she must sit erect, and every time his fore-feet
touch the ground she must tighten the curb-reins,
by drawing them gradually but firmly
toward her waist. She will thus check the
animal's desire to increase his speed, by compelling
him to rest upon her hand at short
intervals until he can be brought under command
and again made obedient. Care must be
taken not to make this strong pull upon the
animal's mouth constant, as this will be more
apt to increase than to lessen his speed, and
will also prevent her from turning him readily
should she encounter any object upon the road.</p>

<p>Should the horse, however, continue to disobey
the commands of his rider, and persist in
his efforts to increase his speed, she must then
lean well back, and "saw his mouth" with the
snaffle-reins, that is, she must pull first one of
these reins and then the other in rapid succession;
this may cause him to swerve out of a
straight course, but if he has a snaffle-bit separate
from the curb this sawing will generally
have the desired effect, and stop him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>If the horse should get his head down and
manifest a disposition to change the full gallop
into a runaway, the rider must, as she values
her own safety, keep her body well inclined
backward, for some horses, when excited, will,
while their riders are endeavoring to check or
control them, kick up as they gallop along, and
the rider, unless she is prepared for such
movements, will be in danger of being thrown.
In such a case every effort must be made to
raise the horse's head. To do this, the rider
must slacken the curb-reins for a moment, and
then suddenly give them a strong, decided jerk
upward; this will cause a severe shock to the
horse's mouth, and make him raise his head and
stop suddenly, a movement that may throw her
toward or upon the front of the saddle with
considerable force, unless she guard herself
against such an accident by leaning well back.</p>

<p>Should the horse, when galloping at full
speed, turn a corner in spite of the efforts of
his rider, she must keep a steady pull upon the
outer curb-rein, and lean well back and in toward
the centre of the curve which the horse
is describing in his turn. All this must be done
quickly, or she will lose her balance and fall off
upon the outer side.</p>

<p>During all these violent efforts of the horse
the rider must keep a firm, steady seat, pressing
her left knee up strongly against the third pommel,
and at the same time holding the second
clasped firmly by the bend of her right knee.
If she recollects to do all this, there will be little
cause for alarm, as it will then be very difficult
for her horse to unseat her. The combined
balance and grip of limbs will give her a
firmer seat than it is possible for a man to acquire
in his saddle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="Fig_32"></a>
<img src="images/fig32.jpg" width="500" height="345" alt="Fig. 32.&mdash;The Flying Gallop." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 32.&mdash;The Flying Gallop.</p>
</div>

<p><b>In the flying or racing gallop</b> the horse
manifests the utmost capabilities of his speed,
his body at every push of his hind-legs being
raised from the ground so quickly that he will
appear as if almost flying through the air;
hence the name "flying gallop." In this gait
it is unimportant with which leg the horse
leads, provided the advance of the hind-leg on
the same side as that of the leading one be made
correspondingly. It is advisable that every
lady rider should learn to sit the flying gallop,
as she will then be better able to maintain her
seat, and to manage her horse should she ever
have the misfortune to be run away with. (<a href="#Fig_32" class="inref">Fig.
32.</a>)</p>

<p>Many ladies, when riding in the country, enjoy
a short exhilarating flying gallop; and for
their benefit a few instructions are here given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a><br /><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that will enable them to indulge their <i>penchant</i>
for rapid riding, without danger to themselves,
or injury to their horses. Before the lady attempts
rapid riding, however, she must be thoroughly
trained in all the other gaits of the
animal, must possess strong, healthy nerves,
and must have sufficient muscular power in her
arms to hold and manage her horse, and to
stop him whenever occasion requires; she must
also have fitted to his mouth a curb-bit which
possesses sufficient power to control him and
to bring him to a stand, when this is desired.
Above all, her horse must be sure-footed, and
free from any and every defect that might occasion
stumbling.</p>

<p>Every point having been carefully attended
to, and the lady being ready for the ride, she
must sit firmly upon the centre of the saddle,
grasping the second and third pommels, as described
above. She must be careful not to
press strongly upon the stirrup, as this will
tend to raise her body from the saddle. From
the hips down the body and limbs must be held
as immovable as possible. The body, below the
waist, must by its own weight, aided by the
clasp of the right and left legs upon their respective
pommels, secure a firm seat upon the
saddle. From the waist up the body must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
pliable, the shoulders being well back, and the
back curved in, so that the rider may keep her
balance, and control the horse's action. The
reins must be held separately, in the manner
described for holding the double bridle-reins
in both hands. The animal must be ridden and
supported by the snaffle-reins, the curb being
held ready to check him instantly should he
endeavor to obtain the mastery. The hands
must be held low, and about six or eight inches
apart, and the rider's body must lean back
somewhat.</p>

<p>Leaning forward is a favorite trick of the
horse-jockey when riding a race, as it is supposed
to assist the horse, and also enable the
rider to raise himself on the stirrups; but as
lady riders are not horse-jockeys, and are not
supposed to ride for a wager, but simply for the
enjoyment of an exhilarating exercise, it will
not be at all necessary for them to assume this
stooping posture. Many of the best horsemen,
when riding at full gallop in the hunting field,
or on the road, prefer to incline the body somewhat
backward, this having been found the
safest as well as most graceful position for the
rider.</p>

<p>As the horse moves rapidly forward, the rider,
while keeping a firm hand upon the snaffle-reins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
so as to give full support to the horse, must be
sure with every stride of the animal to "give
and take," and this motion, instead of being
limited to the hands and wrists, as in all other
gaits, must in this one embrace the whole of
the fore-arms, which, using the elbows as a
hinge, should move as far as is necessary.</p>

<p>To <b>stop the horse</b> in a flying gallop, the
curb-reins must be drawn upward and toward
the waist gradually, for should they be pulled
upon suddenly it would be apt to stop him so
abruptly that he would either become overbalanced,
or cross his legs, and fall.</p>

<p>In this gait, the rider should never attempt
to turn her horse except upon a very large circle,
because, even when in the proper position,
unless she possesses great muscular power, she
will be almost certain to be thrown off on the
outward side by the forcible and vigorous impetus
imparted.</p>

<p>A lady rider who has the nerve and confidence
to ride a hand gallop, or a flying gallop,
will be ready to learn to leap. Indeed, instruction
in this accomplishment should always be
given, as it is of great assistance in many emergencies.
The most gentle horse may become
frightened, shy suddenly to one side, or plunge
violently for some reason or other, and these
abrupt movements strongly resemble those of
leaping; if, therefore, the rider understands the
leap, she will know better how to maintain her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
equilibrium. Or she may meet some obstruction
on the road, as the trunk of a tree felled by a
storm; when, instead of being compelled to return
home without finishing her ride, she can
leap over the obstacle. Again, should she at
any time be in great haste to reach her destination
she may, by leaping some low gap in a
fence, or some small stream, be able to take one
or more short cuts, and thus greatly lessen the
distance she would have had to ride on the
road.</p>

<p>Leaping is by no means difficult to learn.
With an English saddle, the third pommel will
prevent the rider from being shaken off by the
violence of the motion, and will thus make leaping
entirely safe for a lady provided the horse
be well-trained and sure-footed. Before venturing
upon a leap, three requisites are necessary:
first, the horse must be a good and
fearless leaper; second, the rider must have
confidence in herself and steed, because any
nervousness on her part will be apt to cause the
animal to leap awkwardly; and third, she must
always be sure of the condition of the ground
on the opposite side of the object over which
the leap is to be made&mdash;it must neither slope
abruptly down, nor present any thorny bushes,
nor be so soft and soggy that the horse will be
apt to sink into it. No risk must be taken in
the leap, except in cases of emergency, when, of
course, the rider may have neither time nor opportunity
to select her ground, and be obliged
to leap her steed over the nearest available
point. The author once avoided what might
have proved a serious accident to both herself
and horse, by promptly leaping him over a
hedge of thorn bushes, upon the other side of
which was a river: this was done in order to
avoid colliding in a narrow road with a frightened,
runaway team, which was quite beyond
the control of its driver.</p>

</div>

<p>The <b>standing leap</b> will prove more difficult
to learn than the flying leap, but, nevertheless,
it should be the first one practiced, and when
once acquired, the other will be mere play. A
bar twelve feet long, raised two feet from the
ground, will be sufficient for practice in this
exercise; if a lady can manage a leap of this
height with expertness and grace, she will be
fully able to bound over a still higher obstacle,
should she desire to do so, and her horse be
equal to the occasion. Before attempting the
leap, she must be sure that she is perfectly secure
upon the saddle, with her left knee directly
under the third pommel so as to press it firmly
against the latter as the horse rises to the leap;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a><br /><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
her left leg, from the knee to the stirrup, must
hang perpendicularly<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> along the side of the
horse, the inner surface or side of the knee
lightly pressing against the saddle-flap; her
foot must be well placed in the stirrup; her
seat directly in the centre of the saddle; her
body erect and square to the front; her shoulders
well back; and the small of her back
curved in. The right leg must firmly grasp the
second pommel as the horse rises, and the right
heel be held somewhat back, and close to the
fore-flap of the saddle. The hands must be
held low, and about six inches apart, with a
snaffle-rein in each, and the curb-reins must be
so placed that the rider will not unconsciously
draw upon them, but must not hang so loosely
as to become caught accidentally upon any projecting
article with which they may come in contact.
If all these points be carefully attended
to, just previous to walking the horse up to the
bar, the rider will be in correct position and
ready for the leap, which she will accomplish
very quickly, with perfect security, and with a
much firmer seat than that obtained by the
most finished horseman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<p>The principal movement for which the rider
should be prepared in leaping is that of being
thrown forward on the saddle, both when the
horse makes the spring and when his fore-feet
touch the ground. In order to avoid this accident,
the rider, keeping a firm seat and grasp
upon the pommels, must incline her shoulders
somewhat backward, both when the horse
springs from the ground and also during the
descent, the amount of inclination varying with
the height of the leap. The erect position
should be resumed when the hind-legs have
again touched the ground. In a very high
leap, the rider's body should be bent so far back
during the descent as to look almost as if in
contact with the back of the horse.</p>

<p>When the points named above have been attended
to, the horse must be collected, with his
hind-legs well under him, and then be briskly
walked up to the bar or obstacle to be leaped
and placed directly before it, but not so close
that he cannot clear it without striking his
knees against it as he rises,&mdash;sufficient room
must always be allowed him for his spring.
Now, after receiving a light touch or pull upon
the reins to tell him that his rider is ready, he
will raise himself upon his hind-legs for the
leap. As he rises, the rider's body, if properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
seated, as heretofore explained, will naturally
assume a sufficient inclination forward without
any effort on her part. While in this position
she must not carry her shoulders forward, but
must keep them well back, with the waist well
curved in as when sitting erect. It should
never be forgotten that in the rise during the
leap, just previous to the spring, no efforts
whatever must be made by the rider to support
the horse, or to lift him, but instead, she should
simply hold the reins so lightly that his mouth
can just be felt, which is called "giving a free
rein." If the reins be allowed to hang too
loosely they may catch upon some object not
noticed by the rider, and not only be wrenched
from her hands, but also give the horse's mouth
a severe jerk, or perhaps throw him upon the
ground. Too loose a rein would, moreover, be
apt to make it impossible for her to give timely
support to the animal as his fore-feet touched
the ground. The leap, it must be borne in
mind, is effected very quickly. (<a href="#Fig_33" class="inref">Fig. 33.</a>)</p>

<p>As the horse springs from his hind-legs to
make the leap, the rider must advance her
arms, with her hands held as low as possible
so as to give him a sufficiently free rein to enable
him to extend himself; this position of the
arms will also prevent the reins from being forcibly
wrested from her hands by the horse's
movements. At the moment of the spring and
the advance of the arms, the rider's body must
be inclined backward, the erect position of the
waist and shoulders being, however, maintained.
As the animal's fore-feet touch the ground, the
hands must be gently drawn in toward the
waist in order to support him, as such support
will be expected by the horse, and must be continued
even after his hind-legs rest upon the
ground, so that the animal will not become disunited,
but will move onward in a collected
manner. (<a href="#Fig_34" class="inref">Fig. 34.</a>)</p>


<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Many riding-teachers instruct their pupils to
incline the body well forward as the horse rises,
while others require their pupils to lean well
back. The advocates of the former method say
that this forward inclination conforms to the
position of the horse at the time, and so places
the weight of the body as to assist the horse in
his spring. They who adopt the other method
maintain that if the body be inclined forward
in the rise, it will be almost, if not quite, impossible
for the rider, from the rapidity with
which the horse extends himself, to make the
backward inclination in time to enable her to
regain her balance quickly. A happy medium
will prove the best. If the rider be seated correctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a><br /><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
at the time the horse rises, her body <i>will
naturally incline a little forward</i>, and there will
be but little weight upon the horse's hind-quarters,
while, as he springs and extends himself
in his leap, she can promptly adapt herself
to his movements and incline her body backward.</p>

<p>By leaning back as the horse rises on his
hind-legs, the weight of his rider will be thrown
upon his hind-quarters, and she will present an
awkward appearance; while at the same time
she will be very apt to shorten the reins, and
thus confine the horse so much that his leap will
become clumsy and dangerous.</p>

<p>On commencing the leap the rider, as heretofore
stated, must never attempt to raise the
horse by the reins; a light, gentle touch or
pull given to them with the fingers, as when
starting upon a hand gallop, is all that will be
necessary. The horse must be left free to take
the leap in his own way, using his own instinct
or judgment in order that he may clear his fore
feet from the bar or object over which he has
to pass. During the rise, the rider must carefully
guard against raising her hands, and also
against jerking or holding back the reins, as
either of these movements will discourage the
horse, and, should he be tender mouthed, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
will refuse to leap at all, his own instinct warning
him that it is dangerous to attempt it under
such conditions.</p>

<p>A rather hard mouthed, courageous animal,
that has had experience with awkward riders,
will, as he extends himself in the leap, force
his rider's hands by a sudden jerk of his head,
so as either to pull the reins out of her hands,
or, should she manage to retain her hold upon
them, to pull her forward upon the saddle.</p>

<p>Many ladies, in their fear of becoming displaced
during the leap, will unconsciously press
their left leg and foot strongly against the side
of the horse, thus causing him to swerve or to
refuse to leap. Gentlemen teachers are apt to
be unaware of this pressure, as the leg is hidden
underneath the riding skirt, and not unfrequently
they have been puzzled to comprehend
why a well-trained, docile horse should leap
very well with some of their lady pupils, and
awkwardly, or not at all, with others.</p>

<p>A common error, in attempting to leap, is to
sit too far back upon the saddle, a position that
not only prevents the rider from supporting
herself properly by the pommels, but is also
likely to occasion her a severe jar as the horse's
feet touch the ground. When in the correct
position, the body is placed as far forward upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the saddle as the pommels will permit, the waist
and shoulders only being inclined backward, as
already described.</p>

<p>Pressing heavily upon the stirrup is another
fault. This not only destroys the usefulness of
the third pommel, but, as has already been remarked,
such pressure will tend to lift the body
from the saddle. The foot should merely be
kept light and steady in the stirrup.</p>

<p>It will be better for a beginner to leap with a
snaffle-rein in each hand. After having thoroughly
learned how to make the leap properly,
she may then prefer to hold all the reins in the
left hand. In this case, she must be very careful
not to throw up the unoccupied right hand
and arm as the horse passes over the obstacle;
for, besides being a very ungraceful movement,
it may lead the horse to suppose that he is
about to be struck with the whip, and so cause
him to make the leap precipitately, and upon
reaching the ground to gallop wildly off.</p>

<p>The rider must hold her head firm, not only
for the sake of appearances, but also to escape
biting her tongue and receiving a violent jerk
of the neck, when the horse's feet touch the
ground.</p>

<p>If a horse, just before leaping, be too much
confined or collected by an unnecessary degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of tension upon the reins, especially if he be
not thoroughly trained, he will rise from all
four legs almost simultaneously, and also alight
upon them all together. In horse-jockey's <i>parlance</i>
this is termed a "buck-leap." It is an
awkward manner of leaping, and gives a severe
shock to the animal beside fearfully jolting his
rider. Again, a horse not well trained in the
leap, or somewhat indolent, may, if not animated
and properly collected just before rising,
fail to leap over the obstacle, or in passing over
it may strike it with his hind-feet, for he will
attempt the leap in a loose, straggling manner.
An animal that is well trained, and accustomed
to leaping, will take care of himself, and will
require very little assistance from his rider; a
light hand upon the reins just before he rises,
a free rein as he extends himself, and support
when he touches the ground being all that is
necessary.</p>

<p>Should the lady be expert in riding, and desire
to teach her steed to leap, she can readily
do so by pursuing the following course: Let
a bar about twelve feet in length, and two feet
from the ground, be so arranged that the horse
cannot pass around it. If possible, he should
be allowed to see a well-trained horse leap over
this bar a number of times; then taking advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of a time when her horse is hungry, his
mistress should give him a few oats and, passing
over the bar, she should rattle the oats and
call to him, when he will bound over to obtain
them. This course should be followed at each
meal, and she should reward him by feeding,
caressing, and praising him every time he leaps
the bar,&mdash;the object being to accustom him
to leap it without being whipped or treated
harshly. By thus being allowed to take the
leap of his own accord and without assistance,
he will gain confidence, and will not be apt to
refuse when his rider is placed upon his back.
In the course of this training, the appearance
of the bar should be changed in various ways,
as, for example, by placing different bright colored
articles upon it, such as pieces of carpet,
rugs, shawls, etc. If he be accustomed to leap
only over an object that invariably presents the
same appearance, he may refuse to leap one of
a different aspect.</p>

<p>Having thus trained the horse until he has
become quite familiar with the movements of
the leap, and does not refuse to pass over the
bar, whatever appearance it may present, he
will then be ready for his rider. For the first
few trials the lady should take care to have the
bar consist of some material that can readily be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
broken, in order to prevent any accident should
the horse, in passing over with her weight upon
his back, strike it with either his fore or hind
feet. Once mounted, she should teach him to
clear the bar in a deliberate manner, not allowing
him to rush at it and jump from all four
feet at once. She will have to collect him, cause
him to place his hind-legs under him so that, as
he rises, his weight will be thrown upon his
haunches, and, as he leaps over, she must be
exceedingly careful not to restrain him in the
least, as any thoughtless act or awkwardness on
her part may give him a great distaste for an
exercise which, otherwise, he would have no
reluctance in performing.</p>

<p>With regard to teaching a young horse to
leap, the author is much gratified to know that
her views are sustained by several eminent
equestrians, and among them Mr. E. Mayhew
of England, who states that a horse should
never be allowed to leap until he has attained
at least his fifth year, and who in his excellent
work, entitled "The Illustrated Horse Management,"
etc., remarks: "To place a rider upon
an animal's back and then to expect a bar to be
cleared is very like loading a young lady with
a sack of flour, as preparatory to a dancing lesson
being received. This folly is, however, universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
practiced; so is that of teaching the
paces, when the quadruped's attention is probably
engrossed by the burden which the spine
has to sustain.</p>

<p>"Leaping is best taught by turning the horse
into a small paddock having a low hedge or hurdle-fence
across its centre. A rider should, in
sight of the animal, take an old horse over several
times. The groom who brings the corn at
the meal hour then goes to that side where the
animal is not and calls, shaking up the provender
all the time his voice sounds. The boundary
will soon be cleared. When half the quantity
is eaten, the man should proceed to the opposite
compartment and call again. If this is done
every time the young horse is fed, the fence
may be gradually heightened; after six months
of such tuition, a light rider may be safely
placed upon the back.</p>

<p>"Instruction, thus imparted, neither strains
the structures nor tries the temper. The habit
is acquired without those risks which necessarily
attend a novel performance, while a burden oppresses
the strength, and whip or spur distracts
the attention. The body is not disabled by the
imposition of a heavy load before its powers are
taxed to the uttermost. The quadruped has all
its capabilities unfettered, and, in such a state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
leaping speedily becomes as easy of performance
as any other motion."</p>

<p>Horses leap in different ways; the best leapers
being those which just glide over the object
without touching it,&mdash;they appear to measure
the height required for the leap, and, whether
the object be high or low, they skim close to it.
Such animals can be trusted, and may be allowed
to leap without urging or hurrying them,
for they require very little assistance from their
riders, and do better when left to themselves.
Other horses exaggerate the leap and rise higher
than is required; they make a very fine appearance
when leaping, but are apt to light too close
to the opposite side of the bar or obstacle, because
they expend all their energies on height
instead of width. The worst leapers are those
which, instead of clearing the bar at a single
bound, make two bounds, as it were, in passing
over it: the fore-part of the horse having passed
over, the body will seem to be resting for an appreciable
time upon the fore-legs.</p>

<p>The <b>flying leap</b> can be taken, without stopping,
from any gait that is more rapid than a
walk, though commonly taken from the gallop.
It is a very easy leap, being little more than an
extended gallop. The rider takes the same firm,
central position upon the saddle as has been described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
for the standing leap. In the flying leap
the body must be inclined well back from the
start, care being taken not to make any forward
inclination whatever. When the horse has fairly
landed, after the leap, the body must again become
erect. The degree of the backward inclination
must be in accordance with the height
and width of the leap. During the whole period
of the leap the hands must be kept low and the
reins be freely given to the animal, which must
be supported as he lands on the opposite side.
As the horse runs toward the object to be leaped
over, the rider must, when about twelve or fifteen
yards from it, gradually relax the reins, by
advancing her bridle hand or hands; and, if her
horse be a willing and good leaper, he may be
allowed to select his own pace, and use his own
judgment as to the proper distance from which
to make the spring.</p>

<p>If the horse be unused to leaping, or be unwilling,
the rider must be upon her guard lest
he attempt to defend himself and avoid the leap,
either by suddenly swerving to one side or by
stopping before the object to be leaped and then
backing, or rearing. These actions are generally
the result of the horse's want of confidence
in his own powers, and severity will only make
matters worse. In a dilemma of this kind, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
rider will have to convert the flying into the
standing leap, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>She must turn her horse and walk him a short
distance away from the object, then, turning
him again toward it, she must encourage him to
advance slowly that he may take a good look at
it; at the same time she must have a light and
ready hand on the reins, just firm enough to
keep his head steady and maintain control over
his neck, so as to prevent him from swerving to
the right or to the left. She should then kindly
and firmly encourage him to make the bound;
and by patience and perseverance in this course
he will generally be induced to do so. After he
has obeyed, she must not make him repeat the
movement several times in succession, as if she
were triumphing over him, because he might
regard such a process as a sort of challenge, and
renew the contest; instead of such measures, he
should be allowed to pass on quietly, no further
attention being given to the matter. By this
change from the flying to the standing leap the
horse can be better prevented from shying, and
on the next occasion will be apt to make the
flying leap over the object without swerving.</p>

<p>The whip or spur should never be employed
to make an obstinate or timid horse leap, as he
will ever after associate such objects as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
over which he has been thus urged or forced to
leap with fear of punishment, and his rider will
never be sure of him when approaching one of
them, for he will either shy, or else bound over
it in such a flurried manner as will prove dangerous
both to himself and his rider. An indolent
horse, that requires to be roused by whip
or spur, is not a suitable one for a lady to ride
at a leap. Some horses will refuse to leap
when traveling alone, but will do so spiritedly
and excellently when in company with others
of their kind.</p>

</div></div>




<p>A lady's horse is generally selected for his
gentleness, soundness, good training, and freedom
from vice, and the rider's management of
him is usually so kind and considerate that he
is seldom roused to rebellion; hence, she is
rarely called upon to enter into a contention
with him. The docility of a lady's steed is almost
proverbial, and when purchasing a horse
the highest recommendation as to his gentleness
and safeness is the assurance that he has "been
used to carry a woman." Horse-dealers are
well acquainted with this fact, and attach a
high value to it, as a sure criterion of the animal's
kindly nature. No lady rider, however
expert she may be, will, if she be wise and have
a regard for her own safety, ride or endeavor
to conquer a really vicious horse; yet there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
may be times when even the hitherto most docile
animal will suddenly display that which in
Yorkshire dialect is called "mistech;" that is,
there may be unexpectedly developed a restive
trait, for which there seems to be no reason.
Even a really good-natured horse may, owing
to high feed and little work, shy, plunge, and
kick, in his exuberance of spirits, and should
his rider not know how to control these sudden
and unexpected manifestations, he may gain
the ascendency, and she be thrown from the
saddle. That which, on the part of the horse,
is intended for good-humored play, may thus,
from want of control, degenerate into positive
viciousness. A skillful rider will manage and
endure the prancings, pawings, and impatience
of her steed,&mdash;which are frequently only his
method of expressing satisfaction and happiness
in carrying his kind mistress,&mdash;and will continue
riding and controlling him until he becomes
calm and quiet, and ceases to display his
impulsive sensitiveness. Again, a lady may
have occasion to ride a strange horse, of whose
disposition she knows very little. It is, therefore,
very important that every horsewoman
should be prepared to meet and to overcome
any eccentric demonstrations on the part of the
animal she may be riding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Some horses are constitutionally nervous and
timid, always fearful and upon the lookout, constantly
scrutinizing every object around them,
and keeping their riders incessantly on the
watch. These horses, though disagreeable to
ride, are seldom dangerous, as they will readily
obey the reins and yield to the hand that has
many times proved its reliability and correctness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shying.</span>&mdash;The position in which a horse
places his ears is a sure indication of his immediate
intentions. When he raises his head and
points his ears strongly forward, it is because
he sees some object at the side of the road, or
approaching, which renders him uneasy or even
fearful. In such a case, his rider must be prepared
for a sudden leap to one side, a whirl
around, or a quick darting from the road. She
must not allow herself to become nervous and
jerk or suddenly tighten the reins, for then the
animal will think that she is likewise afraid, and
that he is justified in his own fright. On the
contrary, she must maintain her presence of
mind, quietly and calmly take a snaffle-rein in
each hand, draw them just tight enough to feel
the horse's mouth, keep his head high and
straight forward, and, as he approaches the object
that has alarmed him, gently turn his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
away from it, so that in passing he can see as
little of it as possible; at the same time she
should press her leg or whip against the horse
on the side toward which he is likely to shy,&mdash;also
speaking to him in a firm and assuring tone
of voice, that he may be led to understand
there is nothing to fear.</p>

<p>In following these directions the rider must
be mindful of her balance, because, notwithstanding
all her efforts, the horse may leap out
of the road; she should sit erect, keep a firm
hold on both pommels with the legs, check him
as soon as possible, and then bring him again
upon the road. Should he swerve and attempt
to rush past the object, his rider must not try
to pull his head toward it, but, holding the
reins with steady hands, must keep him headed
straight forward, and, after he has passed, gradually
rein him in.</p>

<p>Should he make a half turn from the object,
he must be turned completely around, so as to
face it, and then be urged forward by the aid
of the left leg and whip, while he is at the same
time spoken to in a quiet, encouraging tone.
If the horse have confidence in his rider, and
his fright be not a pretense, he will thus be induced
to go by, and on future occasions will
pass by the same object with indifference. Severity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
such as scolding and whipping, will only
render him more fearful, and since he will always
regard the object of his fright as being
the cause of his punishment, he will, consequently,
the next time of meeting with it become
still more unmanageable. But, having
passed it at first without experiencing any pain,
he will gain confidence in the judgment of his
rider, imagine he has made a mistake in being
alarmed, and be satisfied that, after all, there
was no occasion for dread.</p>

<p>A horse should never be caressed, patted, or
coaxed, either just before or just after he has
passed any object he dislikes, because he may
misinterpret these acts, and imagine that he
has done just right in shying, and will, therefore,
be very apt to repeat the act in order
again to receive the praise of his rider. It will
always be better, in such cases, to ride on as
usual, and act as if the matter were of no consequence.
On the other hand, a horse should
never be whipped after he has passed an object
that terrifies him. Some riders are afraid to
whip the horse while he is in the act of shying,
but will lay on the lash after he has passed the
cause of his dread; this will not only be "a
tardy vengeance that crowns a cowardly act,"
but will cause the animal to conclude that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
has done wrong in passing by, and on the next
occasion for alarm he will either delay as long
as possible in dread of the remembered whipping,
or else will plunge quickly by the object,
and, perhaps, add to the vice of shying that of
running away. The course pursued by some
persons of making a horse pass and repass a
number of times in succession an object which
has caused him to shy is an erroneous one, as
it gives him a chance for again resisting, and
makes the rider appear vainglorious and pretentious.</p>

<p>Whether a horse shies from real fright, or
from mere pretense or affectation, the severe
use of whip or spur to force him by the object
he is shying at will always do more harm than
good. Mildness and forbearance, combined with
firmness, will invariably do much more to tranquillize
him and to render him obedient than
severity and harsh measures. Horsemen who,
from actual experience, are well able to advise
say, "Let the horse alone, neither letting him
perceive that we are aware we are advancing
toward anything that he dislikes, nor doing
more with him when in the act of shying than
is necessary for due restraint and a steady hand
upon the reins."</p>

<p>When a horse shies from pretense of fright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
it is either from exuberance of spirits, because
he has not been sufficiently exercised, or else
because he has detected timidity in his rider,
and shies from pure love of mischief and the
desire to amuse himself by augmenting her
fears. Although not intending any real harm,
he may manage, to his own astonishment, to
unseat her, and, by thus discovering what he
can do, may become a vicious rogue, and make
every strange object an excuse for a dangerous
shy. The only remedy for this affectation and
mischievousness will be a courageous and determined
rider on his back, who will give him
more work than he likes; he will then, of his
own accord, soon tire of his tricks.</p>

<p>When a horse that has had plenty of work
and a good rider to manage him nevertheless
continues to shy, it will generally be found that
his vision is defective. If he is a young horse,
with very prominent eyes, the probability is
that he is near-sighted; if an old horse, that
his vision&mdash;having undergone a change similar
to that of a human being who is advanced
in years&mdash;is imperfect for near objects, which
appear confused and blurred; in other words,
that he is troubled with long-sightedness, or
presbyopia. In these cases the horse becomes
fearful and suspicious, and his quick imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
transforms that which he cannot distinctly see
into something terrifying. Ocular science has
not advanced so far as to have determined a
remedy for these visual difficulties except by
the use of glasses; and to place spectacles upon
a horse to improve his sight would be inconvenient
as well as decidedly unique. Animals
thus afflicted are unsuited for either saddle or
harness, as they are more dangerous than if
they are totally blind, and the only safe course
to pursue when one is compelled to use them
will be the very undesirable one of completely
blindfolding them. Many a horse has been
severely punished and condemned for viciousness,
when his fault arose from defective vision.</p>

<p>Sometimes a horse becomes discontented and
uneasy from being always ridden over the same
road; this dull routine is irksome to him, especially
if he be spirited, and he ventures upon
some act of disobedience in order to create
variety and excitement. He may commence by
sideling toward other horses or objects on his
left, or by suddenly turning around to the right.
In the first case, the rider must instantly take a
snaffle-rein in each hand, and instead of attempting
to turn him from the object, she must rein
his head directly toward it, and then back him
from it. By these means, his body will form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
concavity on the side toward the object, thus
preventing injury to the rider or horse, and she
will be able to retreat in safety.</p>

<p>In the second instance, the horse instinctively
knows that he is opposing his strongest side to
the weakest one of his rider, and it is useless to
contend with him by pulling upon the left snaffle-rein,
as he will be watching for this very movement
and be prepared to resist it. He should
be foiled by having the right rein tightened so
as to turn him completely around and place him
in the same position he was in before he began
to turn. He will perceive to his astonishment
that he has gained nothing by his abrupt movement;
and as soon as he has reached the position
stated, he should be urged forward by the
aid of both leg and whip.</p>

<p>This method is usually successful unless the
steed be very obstinate; he may then refuse to
advance at all, and may make another turn to
the right, in which case his rider should repeat
the course just named, and oblige him to turn
completely around three or four times in succession,
and then while his head is in the right direction,
a stroke of the whip behind the girths
should instantly be given in order to compel him
to go forward before he has time to defend himself
and make another turn. Should he again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
refuse, and succeed in making still another turn,
the tactics of his rider must be changed; taking
care not to use her whip, she must turn him
around as before, and then rein him backward
in the direction she desires him to go; she must
keep doing this until he concludes to move onward.
Should this course have to be continued
for some time, it will be advisable occasionally to
head him in the desired direction, in order to ascertain
whether he will go forward; if he will
not, he must again be turned and backed. A
horse can readily be induced to move backward,
when he has determined not to go forward.</p>

<p>During this contest with the horse, the rider
must be careful to retain her balance, to keep
her left knee directly under the third pommel,
and to incline her body quickly to the right as
her animal turns. She should likewise be watchful
of surrounding objects, in order to protect
herself and her horse from any dangerous position
in which he may be disposed to place himself.
In case she is not a very expert horsewoman,
or has little confidence in her ability to
manage the horse, it will be better to have him
led a short distance, and then, if possible, she
should change the road to one he has not been
accustomed to travel; this will divert him, and
cause him to forget his contumacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balking.</span>&mdash;When a horse stops on the road
and refuses to move in any direction, it may be
owing to disease (immobility), or to obstinacy.
In either case, it will be better for the rider to
make no effort to induce him to move, but she
should quietly and patiently remain in the saddle
until he evinces a disposition to advance,
when he should be made to stand a little longer.
If his defense be due to obstinacy, this course
will be a punishment; but should it be due to
disease, the detention will be no disadvantage
nor punishment to him, but rather an advantage,
as it will enable him to gain composure. It is
rarely, however, that a horse proves balky, unless
as the result of some disease of the brain or
of the heart, rheumatic pain, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Backing.</span>&mdash;Should a horse commence backing,
when on the road, he must have his head
quickly turned toward the direction in which he
is backing. Thus, if he be backing toward a
dangerous declivity, he will be able to see that
what he is doing threatens danger to himself,
and will be checked. Then he must be backed
some little distance away from the danger, and
in the direction toward which he is desired to
go. If, however, the horse continues to back
toward the dangerous place, notwithstanding
the rider's efforts to turn him, the safest course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
will be to dismount instantly. Backing is sometimes,
if not very frequently, due to confused
vision, rush of blood to the head, pain in the
head, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gayety.</span>&mdash;When a horse moves one ear
back and forth, or keeps agitating first one and
then the other, at the same time moving his
head and neck up and down, and, perhaps, also
champing upon his bit, he is feeling gay, and
his rider must be on her guard, as he may
unexpectedly jump. While keeping a steady
hand upon the reins, she must urge him to move
forward at a regular and somewhat rapid gait,
for this will be what he wants in order to work
off his superfluous spirits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kicking.</span>&mdash;A horse, when defending himself
against anything whatever, will always lay his
ears flat upon the back of his head; this is his
attitude and signal for a battle, and he is then
ready to kick, bite, plunge, or rear. When the
ears are only momentarily placed back, it may
be from playfulness, but when maintained in
this position, he is angry and vicious, and may
make a desperate effort to throw his rider. In
the company of other horses he will attempt to
bite or kick at them. As soon as he is observed
to gaze fixedly upon any animals in his vicinity,
while at the same time he puts his ears back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and turns his croup toward his companions, he
is then about to kick, and his rider must frustrate
his intention, as soon as she feels his croup
move, by quickly raising his head and turning
it in the direction in which the kick was to be
made. Should he attempt to bite, he must be
driven to a proper distance from the object of
his anger, and his attention be diverted by keeping
him moving on.</p>

<p>A horse will kick when feeling gay, when he
is annoyed, when he suffers pain from any cause,
when feeling playful or malevolent toward other
animals, and, sometimes, when he wishes to dislodge
his rider. Whenever her horse manifests
an inclination to kick, the rider must endeavor
to keep his head up, because he will then be unable
to accomplish much in the way of raising
his hind-legs; but once allowed to get his head
down, he will have everything his own way,
and will be able to kick as high as he pleases.</p>

<p>Every time the horse attempts to lower his
head, he must be punished by a pull upon the
curb-bit strong enough to make him keep his
head up. His mouth must also be sawed upon
with the curb, should he succeed in getting his
head down. The rider must remember to lean
well back, and have her left knee well braced
against the third pommel, as in this position it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
will be almost impossible for him to unseat her
by his kicking. If the kick be made during a
stand-still, a sharp, vigorous stroke of the whip
upon the animal's shoulder will be apt to check
him; but if the kick be made while he is on the
gallop, a stroke of the whip will be apt to make
him run away. Should kicking be an old vice
of the horse, he must be ridden with a severe
curb-bit, that he may be prevented from getting
his head down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plunging, Bucking.</span>&mdash;Plunging is a succession
of bounds, in which the four legs of the
horse are almost simultaneously raised from the
ground, the animal advancing with each bound.
It is frequently an effort made by the horse to
rid himself of something that pains him, as the
sting of an insect, the pinching of the saddle or
the girth, etc. All that can be done in any case
of plunging will be to endeavor to keep up the
animal's head, brace one's self firmly in the saddle,
and sit the plunges out; they will rarely
amount to more than three or four. When a
horse that is not vicious commences to plunge,
it may be due to fear or pain; he should, therefore,
be spoken to kindly, and be soothed. As
soon as he is brought under control, the rider
should endeavor to ascertain the cause of his
movements, and, if possible, remove it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bucking</i> is a desperate effort to throw the
rider; the horse will gather his legs under him
in as close a group as possible, curve his back
upward like an angry Tabby when she espies
Towser, lower his head, endeavor to burst the
saddle-girths by forcibly expanding his abdomen,
and then without making any advance or
retreat bound up and down upon all four legs,
which are held as rigid as iron rods. Sometimes
he will produce a see-saw movement by repeatedly
and rapidly throwing himself from his hind
to his fore legs. These motions will be kept up
as long as he can hold his breath, which generally
becomes exhausted after five or six bounds;
he will then renew his breath and may repeat
the bounds.</p>

<p>When a horse "bucks," the rider must keep
her seat the best way she can. Her body should
be held as straight as possible, although the natural
tendency will be to lean forward and to
round the shoulders; she should also take a firm
knee-grasp upon both the second and third pommels,
keep a steady hold upon the reins, and be
especially on her guard against allowing her
body to be pulled forward as the horse jerks his
head down. Fortunately, very few thorough-bred
horses buck violently, their movement
being more of a plunge. The horses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Russian steppes, and the bronchos and ponies of
our far Western country, are apt to have the
vicious, genuine buck in perfection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rearing.</span>&mdash;With the young horse, rearing is
the last frantic effort to unseat his rider; an old
rogue will sometimes resort to it, having found
his rider timid and much alarmed at the movement.
A lady should never ride a horse that
has once reared dangerously, unless the action
was occasioned by the injudicious use of too severe
a curb-bit. A horse that has once reared
without provocation will be very apt to do so
again. The danger of this vice is, that the horse
may fall backward and upon his rider. This accident
will be especially liable to occur when, in
rearing suddenly and very high, he bends his
fore-legs under his body. While he is in this
position, should the rider feel him sinking down
upon his hind-quarters, she must instantly leap
from the saddle, at the same time giving, if possible,
a vigorous push to the horse with both
hands, as near his shoulder as she can readily
reach without endangering herself. This is
done that he may be made to fall to the right,
and the impetus of the push will also convey
her to a safe distance, should he fall to the left.</p>

<p>When a horse, after rearing, paws in the air
with his fore-feet, he is then employing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
for the same purpose that a tight-rope dancer
uses his balancing pole, namely, to keep his
equilibrium. In this case, there will not be
much danger of his falling backward, unless
his rider should pull him over by holding too
tight a rein, or by using the reins to aid her in
keeping her balance.</p>

<p>The first act of the horse, when he intends to
rear, will be to free himself from the influence
of the bit, and he will attempt to accomplish
this by bending his neck in so as to slacken the
tension on the reins; at the same time he will
come to a stand by a peculiar cringing movement,
which will make his rider feel as if the
animal had collapsed, or were falling to pieces.
This "nowhere" feeling will hardly be realized
before the horse will stiffen his hind-legs and
neck, and rise with his fore-feet in the air, bidding
defiance to all control.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, as the horse rears
his rider must quickly yield the reins and incline
her body well forward, firmly supporting herself
by the second and third pommels; as she values
her life, she must not strike her steed nor pull
upon the reins, but must patiently wait until his
fore-feet come to the ground, when the time for
action will have arrived.</p>

<p>Although she may be taken by surprise when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the horse first rears, she can anticipate his second
attempt, which will generally be not far off,
by taking a snaffle-rein in each hand, holding
her hands low, and the instant she perceives
that he is going to rise, loosening the left rein
and tightening the right, so as to bend his head
to the right. He cannot now complete the rear,
because her action will compel him to move a
hind-leg, and he will then be unable to rest his
weight upon both hind-legs, which he must do
in order to rear. As a punishment, he should
then be turned around a few times, from right
to left; this turning will also be very apt to
prevent him from again rearing. Sometimes
a severe stroke with the whip upon the horse's
hind-quarters as his fore-feet are descending to
the ground will prevent the second rear; as he
plunges forward from the whip, the rider must
be careful to prevent her body from being
thrown forward by the plunge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Running Away.</span>&mdash;The most dangerous runaway
horse is the one that starts off from excessive
fear, as terror will make a horse act as if he
were blind, and he may then rush over a precipice,
or violently collide with some object in his
way. Terrified horses have been known almost
to dash out their brains by violent collision with
a stone wall, and even to impale themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
upon an iron fence. The least dangerous runaway
steed is the practiced one, which runs because
he has vicious propensities; for as he knows
what he is about, he generally takes good care
of himself, and thus, in a measure, protects his
rider, of whose mishaps, however, he is entirely
regardless. Some horses, when urged to do
something that is beyond their ability, or when
goaded by pain from any cause, will run, imagining
that by so doing they can escape the evil.
With these, the "bolt" or runaway is more the
last furious effort of despair than real viciousness.
A heavy-handed rider may cause a horse
to run away, the horse, taking advantage of
the constant pull upon the reins, is liable to
make the hand of his rider a point of support,
and then dash wildly onward.</p>

<p>When, from restlessness, a horse endeavors to
break away, the curb-reins should be taken, one
in each hand, and every time he attempts to
run, a sharp pull should be made upon his mouth
by means of these reins; he will thus be checked
and prevented from starting upon a run. Should
he once get fairly started, it will be very difficult
to stop him promptly. In such a case, care
should be taken not to make a "dead pull"
upon the reins, but instead, a succession of
pulls at short intervals, and these efforts should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
be continued until he comes to a stand; should
the horse manifest any disposition to stop, the
rider should, as he slackens his speed, make a
continued pull on the reins as if reining him in
from the walk, and this will gradually check him.</p>

<p>When a horse runs away from fear or pain,
nothing will stop him except the voice of the
rider in whom he has confidence, and for whom
he entertains affection. In his terror, he will
rely entirely upon her for aid and support, and
if she fail him, the most severe bit will not stop
him. An old offender may sometimes be controlled
by a severe bit, or may be cured of his
propensity for running by being placed in the
hands of a good horseman who will allow him
to run away, and when the animal wishes to
stop, will then, by means of whip and spur,
make him run still farther, and allow him to
stop only when the rider pleases.</p>

<p>The management of a horse when he attempts
to "bolt" has been described in the chapter on
the Hand Gallop. A horse that has once fairly
run away and met with some catastrophe, or
that has thrown his rider, will never be a safe
one to ride subsequently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unsteadiness while being mounted.</span>&mdash;It is
very annoying, as well as dangerous, to have a
horse moving about unsteadily while the rider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
is attempting to mount; this restlessness is sometimes
occasioned by his impatience and eagerness
to start, and may then be remedied by having
him held by the bit, with his right side
placed against a wall, fence, or other firm barrier,
where he can be kept until the lady has
mounted. The horse must not be allowed to
start immediately after the rider has become
seated, but must be restrained until he is perfectly
quiet, and must be chidden every time he
commences to prance. A few lessons of this kind
will teach him to stand still while being mounted.</p>

<p>When the horse from viciousness, or from dislike
to carrying a rider, attempts to evade being
mounted, he had better be disposed of; for
should the lady succeed in mounting she will
receive but little benefit from the ride, as the
bad temper and unwillingness of her steed will
not only make it unpleasant, but even dangerous
for her.</p>

<p>Sometimes the restiveness of the horse may
be the fault of the person holding him, who, perhaps,
either takes too heavy a hold of the snaffle-rein,
thus pressing the sides of the snaffle-bit
against the animal's mouth, and pinching him,
or pulls upon the curb-reins, which should not
be touched. Either of these mistakes will cause
the horse to move backward. Not unfrequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
a horse will violently plunge and kick from the
pain of some injury in his side or back, which,
though not painful when the rider is seated, becomes
so when she bears upon the stirrup. Such
a horse is unsound and not suitable for a side-saddle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stumbling.</span>&mdash;When a horse, not naturally
indolent, and having his ears well placed, allows
the latter to project out and to fall loosely on
each side of his head, he is then fatigued, and
must be kept well supported by the bridle, for
he may stumble, or even fall. Whenever a horse
is felt to trip or stumble, the rider's body must
instantly be inclined backward, her hands be
lifted, and her horse be steadied and supported
by sufficient tension on the reins. Should the
tired horse be walking down a hill, he must always
be well balanced by pressure of both leg
and whip; this will keep him light upon his
fore-legs, and he will not be so apt to fall.</p>

<p>A horse should never be whipped for stumbling,
as it is not likely that he would do so of
his own accord, and it would be cruel to punish
the poor animal for what he could not help. It
may be the fault of the blacksmith in not shoeing
him properly.</p>

<p>Should an indolent horse fail to raise his feet
sufficiently to escape tripping, the proper course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to pursue will be to keep him collected and
make him move at rather a rapid gait, because,
when he is animated, he will lift his feet more
briskly and to better advantage.</p>

<p>A straight-shouldered horse, when carrying a
woman, will be apt to stumble, to bear upon the
reins, and to move heavily on his fore-feet, and
will therefore require an expert horsewoman
to keep him moving in good form.</p>

<p>When the rider hears a metallic clinking
sound at each step of her horse, it will be an indication
that the shoes of his hind-feet are striking
against those of his fore-feet; this is very
dangerous, as in the trot, or gallop, he may
"overreach" and strike one of his fore-legs with
one of his hind-shoes in such a manner as to injure
himself severely, or he may catch the toe
of a hind-shoe in the heel of a fore-shoe so that
they will become locked together, when the
fore-shoe will have to give way and come off, or
a terrific fall will ensue. Some horses overreach
on account of their natural conformation, others
only when fatigued; again, some will be free
from this defect when fat, but will manifest it
when they become lean from overwork, deficiency
of food, or other cause. Young horses
will occasionally move in this manner before
they are taught their paces, but as soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
are thoroughly trained this dangerous annoyance
ceases.</p>

<p>When a horse falls to the ground, or merely
falls on his knees, if the rider be not thrown off
by the violence of the shock it will be better for
her to keep to the saddle, as the horse will rise
very quickly, and if she attempts to jump off he
may step upon her as he is in the act of rising,
or her habit may catch upon the pommel and
add to the peril of the situation by causing her
to be dragged along should the horse move on,
or become frightened and run away. She must
not attempt to assist the horse by pulling upon
the bridle, but must allow him to get upon his
feet in his own way. Should she be thrown off
as he falls, she must free her skirt from the saddle
as promptly as possible and quickly get away
from him in order to escape being stepped upon
as he rises. The fall of a horse upon his right
side is much less dangerous than upon his left,
because in the latter case the rider's left leg
may be caught beneath him, perhaps injured,
and she would then be unable to extricate herself
without assistance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whip and Spur.</span>&mdash;A lady's whip is employed
as a substitute for the right leg of the horseman
in collecting and guiding the horse. For this
reason, it must always be firm, strong, and well-made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
It is also used both to give light taps to
the horse in order to increase his speed, and likewise,
when necessary, to chastise him moderately
and thus make him more obedient. If it can
possibly be avoided, a lady should never whip
her horse; but when it is required, one quick,
sharp stroke, given at the right time, and with
judgment, will subdue him and bring him to his
senses. Deliberately to give stroke after stroke,
or to flog him, will always do more harm than
good, for it will make him wild, vicious, and unmanageable,
and the lady will gain nothing by
it except the reputation of being a <i>virago</i>.</p>

<p>When a horse has committed a fault requiring
the whip, he knows that the first stroke given
is for this fault, and submits; but he does not
understand why the succeeding blows are given,
and resents them accordingly. An expert rider
will rarely whip her horse, and will never become
angry at even the most obstinate resistance on
his part, but will, instead, manage him intelligently,
and subdue him in a subtle way that he
cannot comprehend. She will turn his disobedient
acts against himself in a manner that is
mysterious to him, and which will make them
appear to him to be the will of his rider. The
horse will find himself foiled at every turn, in a
way against which he can present no permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
defense, and there will be nothing left for him
but submission.</p>

<p>When a horse fails in his attempts to gain the
ascendency, and yields to her skill and authority,
she should be generous and forgiving, and
treat the vanquished one with kindness and consideration,
letting him know that there is no resentment
harbored against him. He will quickly
appreciate this forbearance, and it will have a
lasting effect. But while accepting the olive
branch, she should not give him his usual pats
and caresses for some little while afterward, as
these acts might be misinterpreted by him as a
weakening on the part of his rider, or lead him
to imagine that he has been doing right instead
of wrong.</p>

<p>A lady's horse should never be trained with
the spur. The horse that requires a spur is unsuited
for the side-saddle; even the dullest animal
will soon learn that he is spurred only on
one side, and will shrink from the attack by a
shy or a jump to the right, knowing there is no
spur on this side. An indifferent rider may
place herself in danger by unconsciously spurring
her horse, thus goading him to madness,
and to such a frenzy of despair that the only
alternative left for him will be to unseat his fair
rider in order to escape the pain thus unconsciously
inflicted upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>The novice in riding must not be dismayed
nor discouraged by all the instructions in regard
to defending one's self against restive and vicious
horses, as she may ride for years, or even
for a life-time, and never be in any serious danger.
But a time might possibly come, when she
would suddenly and unexpectedly be called upon
to exert herself in order to exact obedience
from her steed, or to extricate herself from a
perilous situation, and then a knowledge of
what should be done will be of great use to
her. Being armed at all points, and understanding
the means required for any emergency,
she will not depend for safety altogether upon
the caprice or the gentleness of her horse, but
chiefly upon her own knowledge and skill; this
will give her a confidence and sense of security

<h2><a id="ADDENDA"></a>ADDENDA.</h2>

<h3>GOOD RULES TO BE REMEMBERED.</h3>


<p>(1.) When in company with a gentleman, an accomplished
horsewoman will prefer to have him ride at the right
side of her horse, because, being thoroughly able to control
her steed, she will require little or no assistance from the
cavalier. On the contrary, if she be an inexperienced rider,
it will be better for the gentleman to ride at the left side,
because, in this position, his right hand will be free to render
any assistance she may require, and he will also be
placed between her and any approaching object.</p>

<p>(2.) A finished horseman, when riding at the left side of
a lady's horse, will not allow his spurs to catch in her dress,
nor will he permit his steed to press so closely against this
left side as to injure or interfere with the action of her left
foot and leg.</p>

<p>(3.) In the park, or in any public place, a gentleman
should always approach a lady on the off-side of her horse.</p>

<p>(4.) When in company with two ladies, a gentleman
should ride on the off-side of them, and never between the
two, unless they request it.</p>

<p>(5.) When obliged to pass or meet a lady who is riding
without an escort, always do so at a moderate gait; this is
an act of politeness and consideration which may prevent her
steed from becoming fractious.</p>

<p>(6.) When passing by a horseman who is leading another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a><br /><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
horse, never ride by him on the side of the led animal, for if
you do the latter will be apt to kick or plunge, and become
unruly. This precaution is essential for the safety of the
horsewoman, as well as for the better management of the
led horse by the horseman. In a crowded place it will be
better to wait until there is sufficient room to pass without
hindrance.</p>

<p>(7.) Give assistance to a companion, or other lady rider,
when it is indispensable for her safety, but do not give advice
unless directly requested. And if, when you are riding
a fractious horse, assistance be politely offered, do not decline
it.</p>

<p>(8.) In city, town, or village, always ride at a moderate
gait.</p>

<p>(9.) Be extremely careful never to ask for a friend's
horse to ride, but always wait until the animal is freely
offered, and when accepted, do not follow the advice contained
in the horseman's proverb,&mdash;"With spurs of one's
own and the horse of a friend, one can go where he
pleases."</p>

<p>(10.) Before setting out for a ride, in company with other
lady riders, the equestrienne, after having mounted, should
move a short distance away from the others, and then keep
her horse perfectly quiet and steady; by this course the
neighboring horses will not be apt to become uneasy and
restive while her companions are mounting.</p>

<p>(11.) Always, when with others, begin the ride at a moderate
gait. A number of horses, fresh from the stable,
when assembled together, are apt, if started on a gallop, to
become too highly excited; and it will always be better to
have them start slowly.</p>

<p>(12.) Should a lady be a better horsewoman than her
companions, and be riding a horse superior to theirs, she
should restrain him, and not allow him to be constantly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
advance of the others. It will be more courteous for her to
follow the lead of her companions, and to consult with them
as to the kind and rapidity of gait most agreeable to them.
The preceding rules of politeness and propriety will be
readily understood and appreciated. A lady under no circumstances
will forget her tact and consideration for others.</p>

<p>(13.) In riding up hill the body should be inclined forward,
and the bridle-hand be advanced, in order to give the
horse space to extend his head and neck, as it is natural for
him to do under such circumstances. In case the ascent be
very steep, the rider may support herself by holding, with
her right hand, to her horse's mane, but never to the off-pommel,
because her weight may cause the saddle to slip
backward.</p>

<p>(14.) In riding down hill the body must be inclined more
or less backward, in proportion to the steepness of the hill,
and as the horse lowers his head upon the commencement of
the descent, the rider must advance her bridle-hand just
enough barely to feel his mouth. Timid and awkward
riders, on descending a hill, are apt to confine the horse's
head too much, thus keeping it too high, and preventing him
from freely stepping out, as well as from placing his feet
firmly upon the ground. By doing this, they are likely to
bring about the very catastrophe they are trying to avoid,
namely, a stumble and a fall. Never ride at a rapid gait
when going down hill.</p>

<p>(15.) It is always customary to keep to the left when
passing by others on horseback or in vehicles, who are going
in the same direction as the rider; and in passing those
who are approaching, to keep to the right. But, in the
latter instance, should anything be present that might cause
the horse to shy, and a declivity, ditch, or other source of
danger be on the right, while none exists on the left, it will
then be safer for the rider to take the left side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>(16.) When crossing a stream, or when allowing one's
horse to drink from it, a watchful eye should be kept upon
him, especially in warm weather, lest he attempt to take an
impromptu bath. If he begins to paw the water, or bend
his knees, the rider must raise his head, give him a sharp
stroke with the whip, and hurry him on.</p>

<p>(17.) After severe exercise, or when the horse is very
warm, he should neither be fed nor be allowed to drink until
a sufficient time has passed to enable him to become composed,
rested, and cool. Many a valuable steed has been
lost because his mistress did not know this simple, but highly
important rule. Again, a horse should never be ridden at a
fast gait just after he has eaten a meal, or taken a good
drink; he should be allowed at least an hour in which to
have his meal digested.</p>

<p>(18.) A horse should never be allowed to drink from a
public trough, if it can possibly be avoided; and when he is
permitted to do so, the trough should first be emptied and
then filled anew. Horses often contract serious diseases
from these public drinking-places.</p>

<p>(19.) When riding over a rough road, the horse's mouth
should only be lightly felt, and he should be allowed to have
his own way in selecting the safest places upon which to
step.</p>

<p>(20.) When it is observed that the horse is moving uneasily,
at the same time violently twitching his tail, or giving
a kick outward or under him, the rider may be certain that
something is hurting him, and should immediately dismount,
loosen the saddle-girths, and carefully inspect the girths, the
saddle, and parts touched by them to ascertain whether a
nail be loosened from the saddle, the skin be pinched or
abraded, the hair be pulled upon by the girths, or whether
some hard object has become placed beneath the saddle, etc.;
she should also carefully examine the head-stall and bit, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
see that all is right about the horse's head; after having removed
or diminished the irritating cause, she should carefully
readjust both saddle and girths.</p>

<p>(21.) If, when riding rapidly, it be observed that the
horse is breathing with difficulty and with a strange noise, or
that his head and ears are drooping, the rider should immediately
stop him, as he has been driven too hard, and is on
the point of falling.</p>

<p>(22.) A lady's horse should never be placed in harness,
because in order to pull a load he will be obliged to throw
his weight forward, thus spoiling the lightness of his saddle
gaits.</p>

<p>(23.) When turning a corner the horse should not be
drawn around by the reins; these should merely indicate the
desired direction for the turn, and should never be drawn
upon more than will bring that eye of the animal which is
toward the direction of the turn into view of the rider.</p>

<p>(24.) Should a horse which is usually spirited move languidly,
and, during warm, or moderately cold weather, have
his hair stand out and appear rough, particularly about the
head and neck, or should he frequently cough, it would be
better to relinquish the ride, have him returned to the stable,
and a warm bran-mash given to him as quickly as possible.
It may be that he has contracted only a cold that can be
checked by prompt measures. But should he continue to
grow worse, a veterinary surgeon should be speedily summoned.
Be very firm and decided in not permitting the
groom to administer his favorite patent medicines, because
such nostrums are as liable to occasion injury to animals as
similar preparations are to human beings.</p>

<p>(25.) A few observations with regard to shoeing a horse
may not be amiss. It may happen when riding on a country
road, that one of the horse's shoes will come off, and the
rider be obliged to resort to the nearest rural blacksmith to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
have it replaced. In such case she will find that some
knowledge on her part of the manner in which a shoe should
be fitted to a horse's foot will prove very useful. The blacksmith
should not be permitted to cut the frog (the soft and
elastic substance in the middle of the foot) of the foot, but
should leave it entirely alone, and pare around the margin
of the hoof just enough to adjust the shoe evenly and firmly.
Country blacksmiths, as well as many in cities, are very
fond of paring and rasping the horse's hoof, as they think
they can make a neater fit of the shoe by such a course.
An eminent writer on the subject of shoeing states that, except
in case of disease, undue paring and rasping are never
indulged in by persons who understand how to fit a shoe to
the horse's feet properly; he also observes: "This is paring
and rasping the horse's foot till it be small enough to fit the
shoe, rather than kindle a fire and forge a new set which
shall just suit the feet of the animal. It may to some readers
seem like a jest, to write seriously about the horse's
shoes being too tight; but it is, indeed, no joke to the quadruped
which has to move in such articles. The walk is
strange, as though the poor creature were trying to progress,
but could obtain no bearing for its tread. The legs are all
abroad, and the hoofs no sooner touch the ground than they
are snatched up again. The head is carried high, and the
countenance denotes suffering. It is months before the
horse is restored to its normal condition."</p>

<p>(26.) There is not the least necessity for stables being the
foul smelling places they so frequently are, for if the hostler
and his assistants perform their duties properly all offensive
odors will be banished. A foul atmosphere in a stable,
besides being repulsive to visitors, is, not unfrequently, the
cause of blindness and other diseases of the horse, who will
also carry the odor in his hair and communicate it to the clothing
of his rider as well as to her saddle. For these reasons, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
lady should always positively insist that the stable as well as
the horse should be kept perfectly clean and free from obnoxious
exhalations. Attention to cleanliness, and a free use
of disinfectants will bring about this highly desirable result.</p>

<p>(27.) After a ride, the saddle should always be aired, and
placed where the sun's rays can fall upon its under surface.
After exercise that causes the horse to perspire freely, the
saddle should not be removed until he has become cool; this
will prevent him from having a sore back, from which he
often suffers when this precaution is neglected.</p>

<p>(28.) When a lady stops in her ride to visit a friend, she
should always attend to her horse herself&mdash;be sure that he
is properly hitched; that in warm weather he is fastened in
a shady place, and that in cold weather he is protected, as
far as possible, from the cold, as well as from wind, rain, or
snow. It will sometimes happen, especially in the country,
that, instead of being hitched, the horse will be allowed to
remain free, but within some inclosure, that he may nibble
the grass; in this instance, the saddle should always be removed,
as otherwise he may roll upon it. A city horse,
when ridden into the country, should not be allowed to eat
grass, from a mistaken idea that it will be a good treat for
him, for, as he is not accustomed to it, it will be very apt to
injure him.</p>

<p>(29.) After a good seat and attitude in the saddle have
been obtained, more freedom is allowable; should the rider
have occasion to speak or to look aside, she should never
move her shoulders, but only her head, and this momentarily,
because it is required that a good lookout in front be
kept up, to discover and avoid obstacles.</p>

<p>(30.) Delicate persons who desire to derive benefit from
horseback riding in the country should select suitable hours
in which to pursue this exercise. The intense heat of a
summer noon should be avoided, as well as the evening dew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the imperceptible dampness of which will penetrate the clothing
and, perhaps, implant the germ of some serious malady.
Riding upon a country road in the noon heat of a summer
day, where there is little or no shade, will tan and roughen
the finest complexion, will overheat the blood, and will occasion
fatigue instead of pleasure. An hour or two after sunrise
or before sunset will be found the more pleasant and
healthful periods of the day for this exercise. Riding in the
country, when enjoyed at proper hours, is a sure brightener
of the complexion, aerates and purifies the blood, and imparts
wonderful tone to the nervous and muscular systems.
Yet, in their great fondness for this exercise, ladies frequently
carry it to excess, making their rides far too long.</p>

<p>(31.) What to do with the whip, when making a call, has
puzzled many a lady rider. Shall it be left outside, where
it may be lost, or shall it be taken into the parlor, where
its belligerent appearance will be entirely out of place?
This much mooted question can soon be settled by the gentleman
who assists the lady to dismount; he will usually
understand what is required, and take charge of it himself.
Or, in the absence of a cavalier, the whip may be handed to
the groom who attends to the horse, or to the porter who
waits upon the door. But should no groom or porter be
present, it may be placed in some convenient and secure
spot, as would be done with a valuable umbrella.</p>

<p>(32.) Before mounting her horse, a lady should always
pat his head and speak kindly to him, and, after the ride,
should express her satisfaction in the same manner. The
horse will fully appreciate these manifestations. Many persons
consider a horse a mere living, working machine, yet it
has been satisfactorily ascertained, by those who have investigated
the matter, that this machine has feeling, affection,
and a remarkable memory; that it appreciates favors, has a
high sense of gratitude, and never forgets an injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>(33.) The secret of secure and graceful riding is a correctly
balanced seat in the saddle, one perfectly independent
of reins or stirrup, and without exaggerations of any kind,
whether the carelessness or indifference of the instinctive
rider, or the affected, pedantic stiffness of the antiquated
<i>haut école</i>. While maintaining a free, easy, yet elegant attitude,
the rider should present to the spectator such an appearance
of security and perfect equilibrium that it will seem
as if no conflicting movements of the horse could throw her
from the saddle. Carelessness and indifference cause the
rider to look indolent and slovenly, while an affected, exaggerated
stiffness and preciseness give her a ridiculous appearance,
and destroy the pleasing effect of an otherwise
correct seat.</p>

<p>(34.) Go quickly in the walk, quickly and regularly in
the trot, and gently in the gallop. And bear well in mind
the following supplication of the horse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In going up hill, trot me not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In going down hill, gallop me not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On level ground, spare me not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the stable, forget me not."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>All women are capable of enjoying the healthful exercise
of horseback riding excepting those who may be suffering
from disease. Every lady who has the means, whether
young or advanced in years, should learn riding, for its sociability,
healthfulness, and pleasure, without regard to her
bodily conformation. It is folly to deprive one's self of this
high enjoyment and captivating exercise, simply because one
is no longer young, has only an ordinary figure, or because
some persons appear to better advantage in the saddle, and
ride with more ease and grace. According to such reasoning,
one might as well cease to exist. If a lady cannot
attain perfection, she can strive to come as near to it as possible,
and if she secures a correct seat in the saddle, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
suitable horse, she will present a decidedly better appearance
than one who, although having the slender, elegant
figure so well adapted to the saddle, yet rides in a crooked,
awkward attitude, or on a rough moving horse.</p>

<p>To become a complete horsewoman it is not necessary to
begin the exercise in childhood. The first lessons may be
taken in the twelfth year, though many of our best horsewomen
did not begin to practice until they were eighteen
years old, and some not until after they were married. Riding-teachers
state that persons past their first youth who have
never ridden learn much more readily, and become better
riders than those who, though younger, have been riding
without instruction, and in an incorrect manner, and, consequently,
have contracted habits very difficult to eradicate.</p>

<p>Before closing this part of the work, there is one subject
to which the author would earnestly invite attention. When
a lady possesses a horse which has been long in her service,
and been treated with the kindest and most loving care, and
she finds that this faithful servant is becoming old and stiff,
or that, from some accident, he has become almost useless to
her, she should not part with him by selling him, for the ones
to buy him will be those who have no sympathy for a horse
and do not know how to treat him properly, but purchase
him for hard and severe labor; their poverty compelling
them to this course, as they cannot afford to buy any but old
and maimed horses of very little value. To a well-treated
and trained animal, the change from caresses to harsh treatment,
from the pleasant task of carrying the light form of
his mistress to the hardest of drudgery, must be acutely felt.
The horse which has been kindly and intelligently managed
is one of the most sensitive of living creatures, and has
been known to refuse all feed and die from starvation, when
placed under the charge of a cruel and ignorant master.</p>

<p>When the lady finds her favorite steed permanently useless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and cannot afford him an asylum in which to pass the
remainder of his days in rest and freedom from labor, she
should have some merciful hand end the life that it would
be cruel to prolong in the hands of a hard master, simply
for the few dollars that might be obtained for him. To thus
destroy the animal may appear heartless, but, in reality, is
an act of mercy; as it is much better for him to die a quick,
painless death, than to be sold to a life of toil, pain, and
cruelty, in which, perhaps, he may pass mouths, if not years,
of a living death.</p>



<p class="top3">In terminating the present volume, the writer ventures to
express the hope that her appeal to American women to
seek health, beauty, and enjoyment in the saddle will not
be passed by with indifference, and that the lady rider, after
a careful perusal and due consideration of the instructions
herein laid down for her benefit, may be awakened to a
spirit of enthusiasm, and an endeavor "to well do that which
is worth doing at all." To gain a knowledge of horsewomanship
is by no means a mysterious matter confined to only
a favored few, but is, on the contrary, within the reach of all.
The requirements necessary to manage the horse are soon
learned, but, as is the case with every other accomplishment,
it is practice that makes perfect. Practice alone, however,
without study or instruction, will never produce a finished
rider; and study without practice will rarely accomplish
anything. But when study and practice are judiciously
combined, they will enable one to reach the goal of success,
which every earnest rider will strive to attain.</p>

<p>In the endeavor to render the instructions and explanations
in this work as clear and comprehensible as possible,
many repetitions have unavoidably occurred; but as the
book was more especially designed to instruct beginners, as
well as those self-taught riders who have not had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
advantage of a teacher, it was thought advisable not to
leave any point in doubt, but as far as possible to render
each subject independent of the others, and strongly to impress
many essential points upon the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>To a majority of my countrywomen, with their natural
tact and grace, it was only deemed necessary to point out
their errors in riding; attention once called to them would,
it was believed, undoubtedly lead to their prompt correction,
and these riders would then cease to be victims of ignorance,
constantly upon the verge of danger from incorrect methods
of riding, and soon be able to excel in that most desirable
and fascinating of all womanly accomplishments, secure and
graceful horseback riding.</p>

<p>This has been the principal object of the author, who
would not only have women ride well and elegantly, but
with the confidence and enjoyment that true knowledge
always imparts. Having spent so many happy hours in the
saddle herself, she wishes others to experience a similar
happiness, and if a perusal of these unpretending pages will
create a zeal among her countrywomen for this delightful
and invigorating exercise, and enable them to enjoy it in its
highest sense, it will prove a source of much gratification to
her, and she will rest satisfied that her efforts have not been
in vain.</p>

any gait or motion required. See <i><a href="#Aids" class="inref">Aids</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Bars:</i> The upper part of the gums (in a horse) that bears no teeth,
and which is located on each side of the lower jaw. This part lies
between the grinders (back double teeth) and the tusks; or, in mares
and in horses deprived of tusks, between the grinders and the incisors
(front cutting teeth). It is against this part, the bars, that the curb-bit
rests. See <i><a href="#Cheek_of_the_Bit" class="inref">Cheek of the Bit</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Bear to the right:</i> To keep the right leg, from hip to knee, as stationary
as possible, by downward pressure upon the right side of the saddle
seat, and between the first and second pommels, at the same time
keeping a firm knee-grasp upon the second pommel without hanging
upon it; by this means, the rider guards against inclining to the left,
a movement very apt to be produced by her position in the saddle and
the motion of her horse. The body of the rider must be maintained
in an erect position all the time she is bearing to the right. See <i><a href="#Incline_to_the_right" class="inref">Incline
to the Right</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Boot:</i> A term sometimes applied to that part of the saddle-girths or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
flaps back of the rider's leg, and at which the horse may attempt to
kick; also applied to the inferior portion of the rider's leg.</p>

<p><i>Bridle-hand:</i> The left hand. When both hands hold the reins they
are called the <i>bridle-hands</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bridoon:</i> The snaffle-bit and rein, when used in connection with the
curb-bit, but acting independently of it. The two bits together in the
horse's mouth are called "the bit and bridoon," or "the curb and
bridoon."</p>

<p><i>Bringing up to the bridle</i>, also <i>Kept well up to the bridle:</i> To place the
horse's head up and in position, so that when proper tension or pressure
is made upon his mouth he will readily obey the reins. Some
horses require stronger pressure than others, as stated under <i><a href="#Correspondence" class="inref">Correspondence</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Cannon bone</i>, also <i>Shank:</i> The long bone situated between the knee
and the fetlock joint on the front part of each fore-leg of the horse.</p>

<p><i>Canon:</i> That part of a bit, on each side, that rests upon the bars of
a horse's mouth when the bit is correctly placed.</p>

<p><i>Cantle:</i> The somewhat elevated ridge at the back part of the saddle-seat.</p>

<p><i><a id="Cheek_of_the_Bit">Cheek of the Bit</a></i>, also <i>Bars of the Bit:</i> The external straight or
curved rods (levers) forming the sides of a curb-bit, and which, when
the bit is in the horse's mouth, are applied along the outer sides of his
mouth, the reins being attached to their lower extremities. That part
of these rods situated below the bit in the month is called "the lower
bar," or "cheek," and that portion above the bit, "the upper bar," or
"cheek."</p>

<p><i>Chin-groove:</i> The transverse furrow in which the curb-chain rests,
on the under surface of a horse's lower jaw, at the back part of the
lower lip. Also called "curb-groove."</p>

<p><i>Collected canter:</i> A canter in good form.</p>

<p><i><a id="Correspondence">Correspondence</a>:</i> The degree of rein-tension made by the hand of the
rider upon her horse's mouth, which, when properly established, creates
a correspondence between her hand and the animal's mouth, so that the
slightest movement of the one is immediately felt by the other; in all
cases this correspondence must first be had before any utility can be
obtained from the "give and take" movements. Some horses require
a greater degree of tension for this purpose than others, according to
their training and the range of sensibility of their mouths.</p>

<p><i>Croup:</i> The hind-quarters of the horse, from and including the loins
to the commencement of the tail. This term is also applied by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
to the upper part of the animal's back, where the haunches and body
come in contact.</p>

<p><i>Curb-bit</i>, also <i>Lever-bit:</i> A bit with a straight or curved lever or rod
attached on each side, designed for the purpose of restraining the
horse.</p>

it to the upper bar of the curb-bit; there are two of these hooks, one
on each side of the bit.</p>

<p><i>Decompounded:</i> Taken to pieces; each act, movement, or part of a
whole or group, by or of itself.</p>

<p><i>Defend:</i> A horse is said to defend himself when he refuses to obey,
or attempts to bite, kick, etc.; he resists, contends.</p>

<p><i><a id="Defenses">Defenses</a>:</i> The resistances made by a horse when required to do anything,
or when he is ignorant of the acts or movements demanded of
him; he becomes alarmed, injured, or malicious, and employs his defenses.</p>

<p><i>Double bridle:</i> The reins of the curb-bit and bridoon, when both bits
are placed together in the horse's mouth.</p>

<p><i>Dumb-jockey:</i> A couple of stout sticks or poles, crossed in the form
of the letter x, and fastened upon the saddle; the reins are attached
to the upper ends of these, and a hat may be placed upon one of them.
Used in training colts.</p>

<p><i><a id="Effects">Effects</a>:</i> Movements made by the hands, often aided by the leg or
whip, which serve to urge the horse forward, backward, to the right,
or left; indications.</p>

<p><i>Equestrian:</i> A gentleman rider on horseback.</p>

<p><i>Equestrienne:</i> A lady rider on horseback.</p>

<p><i>Equine:</i> From <i>equus</i>, Lat. A horse; pertaining to a horse.</p>

<p><i>Equitation:</i> Horseback riding.</p>

<p><i>False pannels:</i> Pannels are stuffed pads or flaps, attached to and beneath
certain parts of the saddle, in order to prevent these from injuring
the horse; when these stuffed pads can be fastened to, or
removed from the saddle at pleasure, they are termed "false pannels."</p>

<p><i>Fetlock:</i> The tuft of hair that grows upon the back part of the fetlock
joints of many horses' legs, and which hides the ergot or stub of
soft horn that lies behind and below the pastern joint.</p>

<p><i>Fetlock joint:</i> The joint between the cannon and the upper pastern
bone of each foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Force the hands:</i> The hands are said to be forced when the horse
throws his head downward, pulling upon the reins so as to cause the
rider to support the weight of the animal's head; sometimes this is
effected so suddenly as to jerk the reins out of her hands.</p>

<p><i>Forehand:</i> All that part of the horse in front of the rider.</p>

<p><i>Get out of condition:</i> A horse is said to be in "good condition" when
he is well, fresh, and sound; the reverse of this is termed "out of condition."</p>

<p><i>Girths:</i> Stout straps or bands passed from one side of the saddle
and underneath the horse's abdomen to the other side, where they are
buckled tight and fast; they are designed to keep the saddle securely
upon the horse's back.</p>

<p><i>Give and take:</i> The traction and relaxation of the reins made by the
fingers, and which must correspond with the movements of the horse's
head; this action keeps up a correspondence with the horse's mouth,
and at the same time supports him in his gait.</p>

<p><i>Hand:</i> The height of a horse is usually measured by hands, four
inches being equal to one hand. A rider is said to "have hands"
when she knows how to use her hands correctly in controlling the
horse by means of the reins.</p>

<p><i><a id="Haunches">Haunches</a>:</i> When a horse is made to throw his weight chiefly upon
his hind-quarters, he is said to be "well placed on his haunches," and
will then move more lightly upon his fore-legs. The haunch-bones are
three in number, the superior one of which is firmly united to the
spinal column (backbone) near its posterior extremity; the lower one
on each side forms a joint with the thigh bone, passing downward in a
more or less oblique direction. The obliquity of these bones enables
the horse to place the muscles of the part in a position to act with
greater advantage and power, and the degree of this obliquity serves
to distinguish the thorough from the low bred, it being greater in the
former. Wide haunches and broad loins are indications of strength
and speed.</p>

<p><i>Hippic:</i> Of, belonging to, or relating to the horse.</p>

<p><i>Hock</i>, also <i>Tarsus:</i> The part or joint between the cannon or shank
bone and the lower thigh or gaskin of the hind-leg: it consists of six
bones; the part at this joint that projects backward and somewhat
inward is called the "point of the hock." The hock is an important
part of a horse, as any unhealthy or diseased condition of it will prevent
him from resting on his haunches, and will thereby interfere with
his free action in the canter and gallop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Immobility:</i> A disease in which the horse becomes unable to move,
probably referable to the nervous system.</p>

<p><i><a id="Incline_to_the_right">Incline to the right</a></i>, or <i>to the left:</i> This differs from "bearing to the
right," which see. It means, to incline the body, from the hips upward,
to the right (or to the left), either when turning or riding in a
circle.</p>

<p><i>In confidence:</i> A horse is confident, or in confidence, when he completely
surrenders his own will, and implicitly trusts to his rider without
dreaming of resistance.</p>

<p><i>Inward rein:</i> In turning or circling, the "inward rein," as well as
the "inward leg," is the one on the same side as that toward which
the horse turns, or the one toward the centre of the circle of which
the turn forms an arc.</p>

<p><i>Legs well bent:</i> See "<i><a href="#Well-bent_hind-legs" class="inref">Well-bent hind-legs</a></i>."</p>

<p><i>Lip-strap</i>, or <i>Curb-strap:</i> Two small straps stitched to the curb-bit,
designed to prevent a horse from taking the cheek of this bit into his
mouth; an unnecessary appendage when the cheek is curved.</p>

<p><i>Lunge-line:</i> A long strap or cord attached to the nose-band of the
cavesson or head-stall of a horse in training, by means of which the
trainer exercises and instructs him while he is moving around in circles.</p>

<p><i>Near-side:</i> The left side. <i>Near-pommel:</i> The second pommel, on
the left side of the side-saddle; the second pommel of the old-fashioned
saddle was called the "near-pommel," and the name still attaches to
it. The "third pommel" is variously called the "leaping head" and
the "hunting-horn," and is located on the left side of the saddle and
below the second pommel.</p>

<p><i>Off-side:</i> The right side. <i>Off-pommel:</i> The pommel on the right
side of the saddle.</p>

<p><i>Outward rein:</i> In turning or circling, the "outward rein," as well
as the "outward leg," is the one opposite to the direction toward
which the horse turns.</p>

<p><i>Overreaching</i>, also <i>Forging</i>, <i>Clinking:</i> Is when a horse in moving
forward strikes the heel or back part of a fore-foot with the toe or
front part of the shoe of the hind-foot. When the stride of the hind-legs
is carried so far forward as to strike the coronet or upper part of
the hoof, it is then termed a "tread."</p>

<p><i>Pirouette:</i> A movement in which a horse turns around without
changing his place, the hind-leg of the side toward which he moves
forming the pivot upon which he supports himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Port of the bit:</i> The arched part in the centre of the curb-bit.</p>

<p><i>Resistances:</i> See <i><a href="#Defenses" class="inref">Defenses</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Retroacting:</i> A horse retroacts when, in his volts, he steps aside,
bearing his croup to the centre,&mdash;also when he backs toward an obstacle
and fixedly remains there, against the will of his rider; and
also when he suddenly throws himself upon his hocks at the moment
his rider checks or stops him.</p>

<p><i>Ring-bar of the saddle:</i> A bar attached beneath the saddle-flap on
the left side and at its upper part, over which the stirrup-leather rolls.</p>

<p><i>Saddle-tree:</i> The skeleton or solid frame of a saddle, upon which
the pommels, leather, padding, etc., are properly disposed.</p>

<p><i>Snaffle-bit:</i> Is the mildest bit used in driving a horse: there are two
kinds, the plain snaffle and the twisted, and the latter form may be
made to act very severely.</p>

<p><i>Surcingle:</i> A wide band of cloth or leather, of sufficient length to
pass around the body of a horse, and employed either to keep a blanket
upon him, or to keep down the flaps of the saddle or the shabrack.</p>

<p><i>Thrown forward upon his shoulders:</i> A horse is said to be thrown in
this manner when, in moving, he throws his weight chiefly upon his
shoulders and fore-legs instead of upon his hind-quarters; he is then
also said to "go heavy on his fore-legs."</p>

<p><i>Turn upon the shoulders:</i> A horse is said to "turn upon his shoulders"
when he throws his weight upon his fore-legs during the act of
turning; it is a disunited movement.</p>

<p><i>Tusks</i>, also <i>Tushes:</i> These are the canine teeth, two in each jaw,
which grow between the grinders (back double teeth) and the incisors
(front cutting teeth), being closer to the latter than to the former.
They are frequently missing. Their uses are not well known.</p>

<p><i>Volt:</i> The movement of a horse while going sidewise in a circle, his
croup being toward the centre. There are several varieties of volt.
An <i>inverted</i> or <i>reversed volt</i> is when the head of the horse is kept
toward the centre of the circle.</p>

<p><i><a id="Well-bent_hind-legs"></a>Well-bent hind-legs:</i> A horse with straight hind-legs does not possess
good and easy movements; but if these limbs be well bent, he can be
well placed on his haunches, and be easily collected, so that his action
will be true and pleasant. See <i><a href="#Haunches" class="inref">Haunches</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Yield the hands:</i> Is to give the horse more rein by advancing the
hands without allowing the reins to slip. To <i>give a free rein</i> is to
allow the animal all the length of rein he requires without any traction
or opposition.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A very interesting work, by C. A. Piétrement, has recently
been issued in France, entitled <i>Les chevaux dans les temps prehistorique
et historique</i>. The author shows that wild horses were
hunted and eaten by man in the rough stone age. He also determines
in what European and Asiatic regions the eight extant
horse families were domesticated, and traces their various wanderings
over the earth, deducing many interesting facts from the
history of their migrations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> "The Bedouin (and every other race of Orientals that I am
acquainted with seems to possess somewhat the same quality) exhibits
a patience towards his horse as remarkable as is the impatience
and roughness of the Englishman.... In his (the Oriental's)
mental organization some screw is tight which in the
English mind is loose; he is sane on a point where the Englishman
is slightly cracked, and he rides on serene and contented
where the latter would go into a paroxysm of swearing and spurring.
I have seen an Arab horse, broken loose at a moment when
our camp was thronged with horses brought for sale, turn the
whole concern topsy-turvy, and reduce it to one tumult of pawing
and snorting and belligerent screeching; and I never yet saw the
captor when he finally got hold of the halter show the least trace
of anger, or do otherwise than lead the animal back to his picket
with perfect calmness. Contrast this with the 'job' in the
mouth and the kick in the ribs and the curse that the English
groom would bestow under similar circumstances, and you have,
in a great measure, the secret of the good temper of the Arab
horse in Arab hands."&mdash;<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, 1859.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> "There is, however, a medium in this, and the advantage
of length in the arm will depend on the use to which the horse is
applied. The lady's horse, the cavalry horse, every horse in which
prancing action is esteemed a beauty, and in which utility is, to a
certain degree, sacrificed to appearance, must not be too long in
the arm. If he is long there, he will be proportionally short in
the leg; and although this is an undoubted excellence, whether
speed or continuance is regarded, the short leg will not give the
grand and imposing action which fashion may require. In addition
to this, a horse with short legs may not have quite so easy an
action as another whose length is in the shank rather than in the
arms."&mdash;<i>W. Youatt.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It is stated in this paragraph that the <i>marks on the reins</i>
should be "nearly even," or "nearly on a line with each other,"
because, in its passage under the little finger, across the hand,
and on the outside of the right rein, the left one will be shortened
so that its marking will be about half an inch nearer the bit than
that of the right one; consequently, in order to make the pressure
upon the horse's mouth even, the right rein will have to be
shortened to the extent named.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The bridle-hand being in the <i>original position</i> for the double
bridle, the curb should be brought into action by a turn of the
wrist, which will carry the little finger in toward the waist;
and this, in conjunction with the leg and whip, will collect the
horse.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> If the horse be tender in the mouth the snaffle-reins had
better be used in backing; if not, the curb.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> By "bearing to the right" is not meant an inclination of
the body to this side, but a resistance sufficient to keep the body
from inclining toward the left. As hereafter stated, trotting in
a circle to the <i>right</i> will be found an excellent exercise to teach
one this bearing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> If the leap be a very high one, the left foot may be thrust a
little more forward to enable the rider to lean back as far as is
necessary.</p></div>
